BIBLIOGRAPHY

bibtex entries opslaan in de database
    -> student can input book, article, incollection, website
    -> each must be shown on screen, in proper APA/Leiden format.
    -> each fragment has sources/references/book
    -> each text has a BIBLIOGRAPHY

    -> student may select an existing source


    -> one bibtex reference may have multiple fragments

    -> bib_entries are listed in a fragment!

    -> saving bib entries -> document in db bibliography

        "bib_entry_type" = ""
