## About
The Open Source Classics Commentary on the Fragments of Roman Republican Tragedy is an interdisciplinary project between researchers in Classics and Computer Science.

Roman Republic tragedy presents two paradoxes: even though it was one of the most popular genres of its age, it now only survives in fragments, and even though it has profoundly influenced modern visions of Roman culture, it is still greatly understudied and inaccessible to anyone beyond a tiny minority of specialized scholars â€“ working with textual fragments is extremely complex. This project will help introduce non-specialists to these texts, and to grasp precisely these complexities, from technical matters such as the critical apparatus and metrical analysis, to the role subjective editorial interpretation and contextualisation play. Editors are driven by different agendas, which can be philological, cultural or even political, affecting everything from the structuring of the fragments and their arrangement to emendations and translations. This means there is no such thing as a definitive edition, and the collation of different editions is crucial for understanding the history of the scholarship and unpicking the assumptions that shape the field today.

This database will provide a clear and accessible overview of the scholarly traditions, highlighting the differences between editions and their significance; it includes information from editions long out of print and prohibitive or difficult to obtain outside a few select universities, opening up this knowledge to a broader public; it allows the user to view the arrangements of previous editions and to play with possible arrangements, producing new insights into the text; finally, scholars and students are able to add content to the database, enabling greater collaboration in the field. Until now, there has been no tool to work actively and dynamically with the different editions and arrangements of fragments. This database makes this possible.
