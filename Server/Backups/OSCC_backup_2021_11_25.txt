Warmington (1936, p. 133), Marmorale (1950, p. 195) and Traglia (1986, p. 203) suggest that in this scene of dispute it is Liber who speaks to Lycurgus. Klussmann (1843, p. 115) is not sure about the speaker but points out to similar reasoning from Teiresias in Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i> (325). Marmorale also considers whether the king is being advised by one of his satellites or even from the Bacchae. Spaltenstein (§1361) tends to agree, as known dialogues between chorus and characters in choral meters. </p>\n\n<p>In general Liber doesn’t reveal his identity straight away (cf. fr. 37), so we can’t be sure how the speaker assumes ira Liberi. In Euripides the identity and the name of the god were known to Pentheus and his comrades, but they didn’t identify him as the captive. This could also be the case in Naevius so whoever speaks knows about Liber but ignores that the god is present in the uttering of those words (Spaltenstein §1362).</p>   \n\n<p>Duentzer (1837, p. 439) places this fragment exactly before the fr. 26, which holds as a natural continuation of the dispute here. Fragment 21 is thought to be the response of Lycurgus to this exhortation as the theme of soul’s fierceness is repeated. In that case, <i>ille</i> there would most definitely mean Liber himself and the abovementioned suggestions by Marmorale would seem more plausible.

A temple, properly to Fides Publica Populi Romani, was erected to her somewhere between 254BC and 250BC on the Capitoline, near to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the most important temple in Rome. The centrality of Fides, and the connection between religiosity and the upholding of oaths, is the context of Cicero’s quotation of the Ennian line in <i>De Officiis</i>.</P>  <p><b>alma]</b>  Statius (<i>Thebais</i> 11.98) and Silius Italicus (<i>Punica</i> 6.132) both refer to <i>Fides alma</i>. In the case of Silius Italicus, it is in the context of the <i>exemplum</i> of Regulus, and draws on the distinctively Roman character of <i>Fides</i>. The instance from Statius is when the Furies are inciting the brothers Polyneices and Eteocles to fight – if the Ennian fragment does come from <i>Thyestes</i>, this could be a Statian nod to this particular line. </P>  <p><b>pinnis]</b>  the forms <i>pinna</i> and <i>penna</i> were already being used interchangeably in Ennius’ time (e.g. Plaut. As. 80). The better manuscripts have <i>pinna</i>, but then it is worth remembering this is as Cicero quotes the line. And Cicero uses the form <i>pinna</i> more often than <i>penna</i>. Fides does not appear in art as winged. Nor is Themis described as a winged goddess. Other winged personifications in Latin literature famously include Virgil’s <i>Fama</i>. </P>  <p><b>ius iurandum Iovis]</b>  Zeus in Greece and Jupiter in Rome were very often the deities oaths were sworn by. As Kovacs has argued in his commentary on Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>, Zeus, as the keeper of oaths (Zeus Horkios), is responsible for the events of the plot, even if Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>has often been seen as a play where the gods are absent. In the myth of Thyestes and Atreus, the brothers swear a number of vows: one vow made is to cede the throne to the holder of the golden fleece (Atreus believed it was himself, but Aerope had secretly given it to Thyestes); another is sworn by Thyestes that he will give up the throne to Atreus when the sun reverses course. What is meant as an adynaton (i.e.: “I shall never give up th throne to Atreus”), however, will actually come true after Thyestes has eaten his own children (<i>cena Thyestea</I>): the sun turns away in disgust and Atreus proceeds to banish him. The deity responsible for the sun’s reversed course is Zeus. So in a Roman adaptation of the Thyestes and Medea myths, oaths sworn to Jupiter could easily feature. </P>', 'reconstruction': '<p>It is hard to say which of Ennius’ plays this line might have come from. Ribbeck suggested, confidently in his first edition, then hesitatingly in his second and third editions, that it might be the <i>Thyestes</i>. The reason for this can be divined from his comments on Accius’ Atreus in his 1875 monograph: Ribbeck highlights that in the wake of the feast, both Accius’ and Seneca’s Thyestes complain about Atreus’ betrayal of their trust, using the keyword fides. While Ribbeck is not explicit, he presumably thought that Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i>Thyestes might also have this focus on fides and broken promises and that this line might belong to a speech of Thyestes’ after the dinner. </P> <p>Meanwhile, Vahlen suggested <i>Medea</i> on the basis of a couple of parallels with Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>Medea: κλύεθ᾽ οἷα λέγει κἀπιβοᾶται / Θέμιν εὐκταίαν Ζηνός, ὃς ὅρκων / θνητοῖς ταμίας νενόμισται (168-170); and θεοκλυτεῖ δ᾽ ἄδικα <πάθη> / παθοῦσα τὰν Ζηνὸς ὁρ- / κίαν Θέμιν (208-210). In both cases the chorus describes Medea praying to Themis, the Greek goddess of oaths. Vahlen does not quote Medea’s actual words, which are: ὦ μεγάλα Θέμι καὶ πότνι᾽ Ἄρτεμι, / λεύσσεθ᾽ ἃ πάσχω, μεγάλοις ὅρκοις / ἐνδησαμένα τὸν κατάρατον / πόσιν; (160-164). In the Ennian fragment, it is Zeus who the oath was sworn to; in Euripides’ <i>Medea</i>Medea, the chorus mentions Zeus as the father of Themis, but Medea herself in her prayer addresses Artemis, not Zeus, along with Themis. The Ennian line is also in trochaic septenarii, which means that if it does belong to a <i>Medea</i>Medea, it would be spoken by Medea, not the chorus, which means Ennius has heavily adapted Medea’s words. </P> <p>The passage is quoted by Cicero, and Cicero often quotes from Ennius’ well-known plays without attribution to a specific title. He does so with the Medea (TrRF 89, 90) and <i>Thyestes</i> Thyestes (TrRF 134). An attribution to either Medea or <i>Thyestes</i>Thyestes is plausible, although Fides was not a deity at any time syncretic with Themis, so either way Ennius is explicitly Romanizing. </P>', 'status': 'Incertum', 'context': [], 'lines': [{'line_number': '165', 'text': 'o Fides alma apta pinnis et ius iurandum Iovis'}], 'linked_fragments': ['cebda86a0c904ed497793cd3ed6eb83f', '3bb4d80c1bc04aca82b2c60cb12736ff', '92fe6ae803094a6d9ea8dda3e50aaf92', 'b2a025026bfe4f2a852f4c701f1e91e1'], 'lock': 1, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>

The likelihood of feri corresponding to the verb ferio, ‘I hit, strike’, is not high, though this renders the sentence without a verb. Nonius, however, frequently quotes imperfectly, so that we may safely assume feri to be an adjective. For a discussion of the missing verb, see Spaltenstein’s disapproving analysis of reconstructions (2014, Commentaires des Fragments Dramatiques de Naevius. Brussels, p. 496 §1368). \n\ningeni… animi: ingeni may be parsed as genitive singular of ingenium masc. noun, ‘nature, innate quality’, while animi as a genitive singular of animus, noun for ‘impetus, vital force, soul’. The reappearance of ingenium in fr. 34, in an order, directed at those ‘who disquieten the custodians of the royal body’, to go to leafy places where bushes grow naturally and ‘not sowed’ by hand, explicitly contrasts nature with culture, or Bacchic ritual with social life. This is a comparison which may help us here. If we are to understand ingeni as expressing a natural quality, a type of natural power, the threat enounced in this fragment is thus a warning to beware the natural powers of the speaker, who must be considered Dionysus if this comparadum is legitimate. \n\nacrem: accusative singular of acer (n.), ‘severe, violent, cruel’.\n\nacrimoniam: Nonius, as Warmington argues, has defined this word mildly, as ‘vivacity of the soul’. The Oxford Latin Dictionary is more severe and, quoting this very fragment, reads “(of feeling) Harshness, bitterness” (s.v. 3). If we are, however, to seriously consider Nonius’ definition of acrimonia as animi vivacitas, our fragment appears as a Dionysiac injunction to play, to subvert and to destroy. With this in mind, a translation might read ‘May he not … the cruel vitality of my fierce nature and soul’, with our fragment’s language suggestive of the spiritual expansion and social destruction associated with Bacchanalia. \n\nacrem acrimoniam: The strong alliteration found in the fragments of Naevius indicate it may have been a key feature of his poetry. Compare the symphonic alliteration of fragments 18 ubi bipedes, 20 venatu vitulantis, 24 haec flammis flora fieri and 29 inflexu flectitur of this play alone.', 'reconstruction': 'The verse may have stood as part of a threat, though its speaker is unclear. It may stand just as much for the legitimate and terrible threat of Dionysiac power as for the boastful and misguided threats made by mortals typical in narratives of hubris in Bacchic myth. The identification of which kind of threat will wholly influence the interpretation of this fragment. Importantly, the expression of a threat, of a foreboding change of states, of consciousness, of body, fit well with other themes inherited in the fragments of this play. Consider fr. 33, which describes a potential conflict or a showdown, and compare with fr. 19 and 17, which, describing insolence, hints at resistance towards changes and loyalty to one of the belligerents: vos qui astatis obstinati […]. Similarly, our fragment contains a suggestion of a potential change of state against those who resist, of a Dionysus punishing a Lycurgus, or an arrogant Lycurgus punishing his captive prisoner, his divine identity concealed. That even in our few fragments this theme of knowledge appears indicates Naevius to have used dramatic irony to compel his audience’s of his themes’ tragedy, of, in this case, the blindness with which humans injure themselves, and for which gods hate men (cf. fr. 26).\n\n\n In my commentary, I have argued, with attention to the language of fr. 21 and to its relation with the play’s other fragments, that its speaker is Dionysus. I have thus interpreted it as Dionysus speaking of cautioning Lycurgus to beware his violent nature to an unknown interlocutor. However, this attribution may be questioned when considering the form of the play on the basis of its antecedents. In the Bacchae of Euripides, Dionysus makes no statement comparable in its frankness about his nature, hiding his true identity to Pentheus at every successive episode of the play. Indeed, the play’s tragic sense relies much on the dramatic interplay between human ignorance and divine deceit. Though unparalleled in the Bacchae, earlier literature furnishes us with examples of gods speaking of their powers and nature to mortals (Sophocles, Ajax 1-133, Homer’s Apollo in Iliad 16).\n\n\n Importantly, however, another fragment of the play speaks openly of the god Liber, undisguised, his identity probably ascertained (fr. 33). Since Dionysus does not seem to disguise his identity in the Lycurgus of Naevius, we may well imagine the speaker of fr. 21 to be Dionysus, perhaps appearing in an epiphany of the god in full splendour, though where this would fit in the play is unclear.\nThis interpretation, however, is far from consensual. Ribbeck (1875, Die Römische Tragödie im Zeitalter der Republik. Leipzig, p. 60) pursues the comparison with the Bacchae that I am cautious of, interpreting the fragments through its themes of disguise and revelation. He attributes the fragment to Lycurgus, speaking to the god he has imprisoned, unaware of his true identity, and casts fr. 33 as the god’s oblique but sincere response. As a comparandum for cruel spirit he cites the admittedly compelling adjective ὀξύκολος given to him in Sophocles, Antigone 955. Similarly, the fragment was attributed by Warmington to Lycurgus himself, by which he supposed that ille refers to Dionysus, presumably in the process of instituting his cult in Thrace without the king’s permission, corresponding again to the guileless wrath of Pentheus, who thought Dionysus a stranger he could dominate and rule. Marmorale (1950, Naevius Poeta. Florence, p. 195) broadly follows Ribbeck in interpretation, adding that ne is not an element of a negation, but “una particella asseverativa” like the Greek νή, an interpretation found also in Warmington (1939), Remains of Old Latin vol. II, p. 133. Similarly, Klussmann, in his 1843 Jena edition of Naevius, and Duentzer (1837 ‘De Naevii Lycurgo et Ennii Iphigenia’, Rheinisches Museum für Philologie 5, p. 433-46) argue that ille refers to Dionysus. Additionally, Duentzer (ibid, p.440) adds that Lycurgus’ interlocutor is Silenus, though this is merely speculative. Finally, Spaltenstein (2014, Commentaires des Fragments Dramatiques de Naevius. Brussels, p. 496 §1369) reviews the editorial history, noting that the violent nature with which Lycurgus presumably describes himself is typical of both his being a Thracian and his character as a hubristic king, adding that F.H.

Scaliger based his conjecture on a parallel in Euripides’ Iphigeneia in Tauris, suggesting that this passage might be an imitation or translation even of verses 365-368. This line of argumentation is followed by Ribbeck and Klotz. Schierl rejects this on differences in context: In Iphigeneia in Tauris Iphigeneia remembers the fake wedding her father Agamemnon organised, while in this fragment the wedding is real. The other difference is that here only Erigone’s peers are singing, versus the women of Argis and the mother in Euripides. Since we have very little information on the context of the fragment, it is hard to exclude the possibility that this verse in some way imitates those of Euripides, but that of a precise translation can safely be rejected. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, Schierl mentions parallels for aura resonit in Verg.

All the options are not very positive, yet Pacuvius uses it here with hymenaeus, wedding song, or Hymenaeus, God of weddings. That makes for two possible translations: either the girls angrily and loudly call for the God, or they murmur a bridal hymn. Both translations do not make a lot of sense, given the lack of context. Therefore both Schierl and Warmington choose to translate more neutrally and opt for ‘shout’ (Warmington) or ‘lassen erklingen’ (Schierl).

This seems not to be a problem.</p>\n', 'commentary': '<p><b>ignotae</b>] as described in the apparatus criticus, there is a lot of discussion about the reading of <i>ignotae</i>. The reading <i>ignotae</i> is based on one Nonius edition. Many other manuscripts have the reading ignoti or other related forms. The consequence of this different readings is the fact that <i>ignotae</i> certainly refers to a group of woman and <i>ignoti</i> and other forms to a group with at least one man. This issue has consequences for our reading of the whole fragment and will therefore be treated further in the reconstruction.<p/> ', 'reconstruction': '<p>The fragment is between a group and another person. We can deduce this from the fact that <i>sumus</i> (and <i>ignotae</i> or <i>ignoti</i>, according to which reading you prefer) are plural and <i>tu</i> singular. The group does not know where they are and they assume that the other person knows the way.</p> \n\n<p>A metrical analysis can help us to deduce from which part of the tragedy this verse comes. Lindsay has analysed this verse metrically and came to the conclusion that it must be from a choral part (Spaltenstein 2014, 459, 462)  However, Spaltenstein does not agree with this. He argues that a jambic analysis of this metre is most probable. Therefore, this verse is more suitable in a dialogue (Spaltenstein 2014, 459). I agree with him on this point. In my opinion, the contrast between <i>sumus</i> and <i>tu</i> fit s more in a dialogue than in a choral song. This question of metre remains difficult, because lots of editors find the metre obscure (Marmorale 1950, 194)</p>\n\n<p>Most editors have supposed that the group consists of Bacchants arriving from the outside (Spaltenstein 2014, 460). This seems probable to me, because they do not know the way in a foreign land. Düntzer (1837) explains this verse by saying that the speaker repeats the question the bacchants has asked him in a direct style. However, according to Spaltenstein (2014, 460) it is a question which is directly asked on stage.</p>\n\n<p>Since this verse is probably not from a choral song, it is important to think about who are the group of people and who is the speaker from this group. In a spoken part, namely, it cannot be the whole chorus. Spaltenstein suggests that Dionysus is the speaker. In his opinion, we can then read both <i>ignotae</i> and <i>ignoti</i>. When we read <i>ignotae</i>, Dionysus is speaking in name of the Bacchants and when we read <i>ignoti</i>, Dionysus is part of the group himself. But this is not the only reason on which we can base the reading <i>ignoti</i>. When the chorus consists of Bacchants and Satyrs, it is logic that the masculine form is used (Warmington 1936, 126). But, according to Spaltenstein, the choice between <i>ignotae</i> and <i>ignoti</i> is in the end arbitrary, because it is mostly a problem for the editor. It does not matter for the public, because it is always about Bacchants (Spaltenstein 2014, 460-461). Marmorale seems to admit to this. He chooses for the masculine form <i>ignoti</i>, but refers in his commentary to the Bacchants (Marmorale 1950, 194).</p> Bednarek finds the form <i>ignoti</i> more preferable than <i> ignotae </i>, by taking into consideration the fact that the feminine plural is based on the conjectures of editors (Bednarek 2021, 131).\n\n<p>Besides, it is interesting to think about who is addressed. Because the Bacchants are arriving in a foreign country, it is logical that they ask something to a person from that country. In addition, Ribbeck argues that this verse is aimed at Lycurgus or one of his followers. So the chorus can ask the way further or the way to the king himself. However, he also suggests the option that some of the Bacchants ask the way to Dionysus, but he finds the first suggestion more plausible (Ribbeck 1875, 59; cf. Spaltenstein 2014, 461-462). This last option is also proposed by Bednarek, who argues that the followers of Liber are longing for him (Bednarek 2021, 140).</p> \n\n<p>The above analysis of this fragment seems to me the most logical. But there are also other interpretations. First, some have argued that the Bacchants are complaining to Dionysus, because Dionysus encouraged them to go. However, this seems illogical to Spaltenstein because Dionysus comes to a foreign country and does not know the places (Spaltenstein 2014, 461). Second, some have argued that the chorus consists of Lycurgus’ followers and that the speaker of the verse is one of Lycurgus’ attendants. They could be part of the strategy to imprison Liber. When they were sent by Lycurgus to a place in the mountains, they could pretend that they did not know and ask him to lead the expedition (Bertini 1972; cf. Bednarek 2021, 140). Bednarek admits that this is speculative, but he takes it into consideration. When we take this option, the reading <i>ignoti</i> is easily defendable. He also proposes a counterargument against the most common interpretation: the idea that followers of Liber ask Lycurgus for help is weird, especially when they are in prison.This fits in his overall reconstruction of the play, in which he argues that the maenads are imprisoned in the beginning of the play.

It is written in trochaic septenar, a metre that we encounter regularly in Latin comedy and, in particular, in the works of Plautus and Terentius. Trochaic septenar is also commonly used in dialogues, thus we can assume that here there are at least two persons on stage who are involved in a conversation and one of them utters the specific verse. It has been proposed that Orestes is the speaker (cf. D'Anna 205; on Orestes as speaker: Ribbeck 245, Argenio 32, Mette 96) and the addressee is Electra, who is advised to retain her steadfastness in an uncertain situation. Warmington disagrees and places Clytaemnestra as the speaker in a possible discussion that she has with Electra. The line may refer to the dispute between them concerning the marriage of Electra with Oeax. We know that she didn’t want to marry him, so Clytaemnestra’s statement here probably shows her disagreement over this by revealing her distaste for obscuring the psyche with confusion. However, Schierl highlights that we are dealing with a call to persevere, that implies an exhortation (rather than a severe warning), therefore Warmington’s speculation may be wrong. The line could be also uttered by a minor character, for instance the corypheus of the chorus.

As such, interpretations of this fragment vary wildly.</p>\n<p>First is the interpretation mentioned (and thought less likely) by Marmorale (1950, 198): that the fragment simply describes a bright day. This interpretation of the fragment as a marker of time is supported by Klussman (1843, 110-111), who explains it as describing the afternoon or evening. He proposes that the words are spoken by a messenger, one of the guards sent by Lycurgus to protect the borders, who has returned to report to Lycurgus on the capture of Dionysus and his followers. Spaltenstein (2014, 516) similarly explains that the line could describe the thawing frost in the morning before the guards capture and imprison the Bacchants.</p>\n<p>Connected to the interpretation of the fragment as a marker of the time of day is the interpretation taken by Duentzer (1837, 441), that <i>candor</i> refers to snow or ice which is melting away under the heat of the sun. Warmington too understands <i>candor</i> this way, translating the line as “When now the brilliant white of snow was melting in the sun’s scorching heat.” Following this interpretation, the fragment can still be a marker of time, but also one of place, as the snow could refer specifically to the high mountains of Thrace. Marmorale (1950, 198) too thinks that <i>candor</i> most likely refers to a substance that can actually melt. He translates the line as, “whose whiteness liquefied by the heat of the sun” and gives the example of wax. (Note that Marmorale reads <i>cui</i> for TrRF <i>cum</i>, thus translating “whose” instead of “when”.)</p>\n<p>The proposed conjecture <i>caro colliquesceret</i> for <i>candor cum liquesceret</i> by Gerlach and Roth (1842, 229), even allows the interpretation of the line as being about a decaying corpse, making it explicitly about <i>flesh</i> seemingly melting in the sun’s heat. If the fragment <i>is</i> indeed a description of a decaying corpse, placing it towards the end of the tragedy and close to the climax of the story (that is, Dionysus’ revenge on Lycurgus) would make sense. In that case, the speaker could be a messenger reporting on the death of Lycurgus’s wife and/or daughter, or the gruesome death of Lycurgus himself, who, according to Hyginus (Hyg. <i>Fab.</i> 132), was driven mad by Dionysus and fed to the panthers, and who possibly amputated his own leg after mistaking it for a grapevine. Even without Gerlach and Roth’s conjecture, perhaps <i>candor</i> itself too could refer to a body (via association with its pallor). This would lend positive connotations to the deceased in question, in which case it would make more sense for the line to refer to Lycurgus’ dead wife or daughter (for whom <i>candor</i> in life could have been used to describe their beauty) than for Lycurgus himself.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': 'De Compendiosa Doctrina', 'text': '<p>Quoted once by Nonius in relation to the meaning of <i>liquidum</i>, this being “soft and flowing”.

To Spaltenstein’s mind the former is likelier than the latter, as it was a common trope in comedy that old abusive masters should need some kind of frank challenging, and there are cases in which a slave addresses their drunken master more openly.

Both <i>Decoratas</i> and <i>Decoratos</i> could be possible, since they both refer to a group of people, which would fit with the plural of <i>mittant</i>. <i>Decoratas</i> would then refer to the group of women and <i>decoratos</i> would refer to the soldiers of the king. </p>\n', 'commentary': '<p><b>vitulantis]</b> According to Nonius, the meaning of this word is <i>gaudantes</i>: ‘rejoicing’. Some manuscripts read <i>vitulantes</i>.In both cases it can be an accusative plural according with <i>nos</i>. Most likely it refers to the maenads, which would mean that it is the maenads who are about to be punished.

Bednarek (2021) points out that <i>decorare</i> ‘seems to have only positive connotations’ which would make the combination of <i>decoratas</i> and <i>poenis</i> a bit strange. <i>pennis</i> would therefore be a good suggestion, also because this would not be the first time that the maenads are compared with birds. </p>\n<p><b>decoratas]</b> Most manuscripts read <i>decoratus</i> which is problematic because of the plural form of <i>mittant</i>. Therefore, two possible suggestions have been made regarding this word. Some editors have chosen the reading of <i>decoratos</i>. In that case the word would probably refer to the soldiers of Lycurgus, who are being hurt by the maenads. It could also be the other way around. In that case the word refers to the maenads, who are threatened with punishments by Lycurgus and his soldiers. It is in any way clear that this fragment is about two groups of multiple persons, since we have two plural forms in the fragment. This makes it likely that it is about the maenads and the soldiers. The word <i>decoratus/os/as</i> goes together with <i>feris</i>, which makes it more likely that it refers to the maenads, since there are more fragments in which the maenads are compared with animals or beasts. </p>\n<p>Bednarek, B. 2021. <i>The myth of Lycurgus in Aeschylus, Naevius, and beyond </i>.

Because it is not sure if the  word <i>decoratas</i> is the right reading and refers to a group of women, it is unclear who is speaking here. It could be the maenads speaking about Lycurgus soldiers, but it could also be the other way around. Most editors think that <i>decoratas</i> is the right reading of the word. The fragment would then be about the maenads, who are threatened with punishments. This would make sense, since Lycurgus does intend to punish the maenads. If this word is indeed right, the fragment could be spoken by the maenads against Lycurgus and his soldiers, complaining about the threats that Lycurgus made to punish them. In this case, the fragment should be placed somewhere in the tragedy after the maenads have been arrested. It could also be the case that one maenad is speaking to another about the threats that Lycurgus made, as Ribbeck suggests. This would mean that the lines are spoken by a maenad, before the women are arrested. In any case it is clear that the women are not yet punished, but only threatened to be punished, because of the construction with <i>ut</i>, which shows that Lycurgus is intending to hurt the women. </p>\n<p>If <i>decoratos</i> is the right reading of the word, it would refer to the soldiers of Lycurgus. In this case the fragment should be placed later in the tragedy, after the maenads have already been taken captive. After their release, Liber will take revenge on Lycurgus for hurting the women, so that it would be possible that the maenads are intending to punish the soldiers of Lycurgus. However, the first reading seems to be more plausible, because of <i>vitulantis</i>, which is most likely an accusative and it would make more sense if this word would refer to the women who are rejoicing in the hunt rather than to the soldiers of Lycurgus. </p>\n', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina', 'text': '<p>Quoted by Nonius in <i>De compendiosa doctrina</i></p> <p>The text is quoted by Nonius to point out the meaning of <i>vitulantes</i>, which means ‘rejoicing’: </p> <p><i>vitulantes veteres gaudentes dixerunt: dictum a bonae vitae commodo; sicuti qui nunc est in summa Laetitia, vivere eum dicimus.

Westman (1980) XVIII). K<sup>2</sup> signifies a correction from the L tradition. But <i>quin</i> does not make sense here, so <i>qui</i> should be preferred. That <b>E</b> has the reading <i>que</i> strongly suggests scribal confusion over an abbreviated form for <i>qui</i>.<br>Bothe thought that the line as it stood was an incomplete trochaic tetrameter. Alternatively he offered the conjecture <i>senecta</i> to turn it into a <i>versus asynartetus</i> (the repetition of two metrical patterns within a single line as if each were self contained) consisting of two ithyphallics. However, the second element of an ithyphallic is usually short. However, it might be a mistake to speak of a strict metrical character to the ithyphallic metre in Latin poetry of the stage: there is one double ithyphallic line in Plautus, <i>Epid.</i> 546, but it is of almost completely different character, with not only five natural shorts but also the three of the four trochaic longs resolved into shorts. But it is unusual to have a complex metre like the ithyphallic in dialogue, which might be why Bothe suggested it uncertainly, and also hypothesised the transmitted reading was a trochaic tetrameter. <br>If Bothe’s <i>senecta</i> is adopted, it is simpler to think of it as a normal bacchiac quarternarius (so Ribbeck 1875, 200). However, there is no manuscript evidence that the reading is wrong, and the reading <i>senectute</i> that is transmitted can be understood as a bacchiac quaternarius <i>hypermetricus</i>, with the short e at the end of <i>senectute</i> providing an extra element after the four bacchiacs. Since this is an open syllable, it could also be the case that the next line began with a vowel, elided via synaloephea and so there is not an extra element at all (the phenomenon is observed in dactylic hexameter lines in epic (e.g. Ver. <i>G.</i> 1.295, 3.449, Ov. <i>Met.</i> 4.11). There don’t seem to be any examples of hypermetrical bacchiac quaternarii in Plautus, for instance, but that may be precisely for the reason that Cicero quotes <i>TrRF</i> 133, that such lines might not be easily distinguishable as verse rather than prose. And as Jocelyn (1967, 422) highlights, <i>senecta</i> in first century Republican texts was a highly poetic word, whereas <i>senectute</i> was more redolent of prose. A fragment of Varro provides evidence for the use of a Bacchiac system with enjambement (characteristic of synaphea) – the line also seems to be a strong echo of <i>TrRF 133</i>: <i>quaenam te esse dicam, fera qui manu cor- / poris seruidos fortium aperis lacus san- / guinis, teque vita levas ferreo ense?</i>. The upshot is that it is probably better to let the transmitted manuscript reading of <i>senectute</i> stand.<p>', 'commentary': '<p><b>dicam]</b> Levée (1823) and Giles (1834) divide this fragment between two speakers, the first part being a direct question, followed by an answer of the addressee. However, given this was a sung line, it is perhaps more likely that we are dealing with one voice in this fragment, who asks an older addressee a question.<br><b>senectute]</b> The archaic form senecta is substituted for senectute by Bothe to create a more regular bacchiac tetrameter, instead of the earlier shortened or incomplete trochaic octonarius (tr8 mutil.). Jocelyn (1967, 422) argues convincingly for the reading of <i>senectute</i> (resulting in a quaternarius bacchiacus hypermetricus) because the use of a highly poetic word like <i>senecta</i> would undermine Cicero’s point that the verse would sound like prose without musical accompaniment.', 'reconstruction': '<p>The fragment deals with an encounter between a speaker who comes into contact with and addresses an unfamiliar (<i>quemnam</i>), older figure (<i>in senectute</i>).<br>Based on Cicero’s statement – that the verse was originally accompanied by the music of a flute player (<i>tibicen</i>) – it can be argued that the verse was either part of a sung dialogue between multiple characters, or that it belongs to a choral <i>cantica</i>. Both options are valid, but it must be noted that verses in bacchiac metres – if we decide to read this verse as a quaternarius bacchiacus hypermetricus – are closely related to choral songs. However, the metre can also signify the approach of a new character (sc. the older addressee) on stage.<br> The identification of the speaker and addressee in this verse – as in most fragments of early Roman drama – remains very difficult because the narrative structure and plot of Ennius Thyestes is very uncertain. Different options have been proposed: Welcker (1839, 683) suspects that Atreus converses with an old servant. Ribbeck (1875, 200) agrees with Welcker on the fact that the speaker is probably Atreus, but adds that the addressee might be the chorus, made up of Mycenean elders. Mette (1964, 15) interprets the verse as part of a speech between the chorus and an older messenger, while Webster (1967, 144) is convinced that the chorus is speaking to Thyestes who has just arrived in Mycenae. Jocelyn (1967, 414, 419-421) believes the question posed in this fragment is answered by a reply of Thyestes, who makes himself known to the audience (=<i>TrRF</i> 55 <i>adesp.</i>). The fact that we are dealing with an older addressee might suggest that this verse is not spoken to Thyestes, who is not old, nor to a messenger, because old people are not likely to be retained as couriers. The interpretation of the fragment as a speech between Atreus and an older servant who has come to inform his master of Thyestes’ evil plan, might be the most plausible. If this is the case, the metre would underline the ominous tone of the servant’s arrival, who might visit his master to bring the ominous news about Thyestes’ intentions.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [], 'lines': [{'line_number': '133', 'text': 'quemnam te esse dicam, qui tarda in senectute'}], 'linked_fragments': ['ff0a41e3963d4c2d93b1802aef5273fc', 'ec0c4ff717ef4a1ba8ef4f11ed1004a3', '6a4de51dafab4c80ac7f5b4d38ba186a', '53b4103cea6d4108946666fc520a13e8'], 'lock': 1, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>

The speaker points to power that has once been his, but at this point has all vanished. Especially significant seems to be the first verse: the speaker is emphasizing that at this point, it is Fortune that is failing him, instead of his birth, perhaps implying that his lineage has troubled him. This obviously makes a case for either Thyestes or Atreus as speaker of these words, since Myrtilus cursed Pelops, the father of Atreus and Thyestes. Thyestes seems a natural fit: in Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i> he is depicted as a beggar in his exile, before his return to Mycenae in the course of the play. If the speaker’s point is that he has fallen from power due to a twist of fate, this would be appropriate to Thyestes losing the throne to Atreus and being exiled because of the Sun’s reversal (according to the telling of Apollodorus (<i>Epit.</i> 2.12). </p>\n<p>Besides the attribution of this fragment to Ennius, scholars are not totally agreed that the lines are from his <i>Thyestes</i>.

However, Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i> is favoured by the majority of scholars, including Ribbeck (who revised his opinion in his 1875 monograph) and Paduano (1974: 48).

Cicero then quotes three fragments, all depicting characters in severe distress, illustrating that an Epicurean way of thinking about the relief of sorrow would not work for them. A first fragment is about Telamon (in which astonished men ask whether the man they are seeing is really Telamon). Regarding the second fragment, the subject is uncertain: presumably, one of the other characters mentioned as examples earlier (Thyestes or Aetes). Cicero asks how a man is supposed to get rid of his sorrow, if he speaks in the following way – immediately followed by fragment 157.

Again, see further the commentary below.</p>', 'commentary': '<p><b>prognatus:]</b> This word appears comparatively rarely in comedy (only 14 occurrences in Plautus), but is more frequent in early Republican epic and tragedy (cf. Fraenkel (1957) 82 n.4). It also is found in the epitaph of Scipio Barbatus, which is written in Saturnian verse: <i>Cornelius Lucius Scipio Barbatus Gnaivod patre prognatus / fortis uir sapiensque…</i>  (“Cornelius Lucius Scipio Barbatus, the offspring of his father Gnaeus, was a brave and wise man…”) CIL VI 1285). <i>prognatus</i> can refer to any descendant – in the Scipio Barbatus epitaph it refers to a son, in <i>TrRF adesp.</i> 55 it refers to a ‘grandson’, Thyestes, whose grandfather was Tantalus.  </p>\n<p><b>socru]</b>The more common form of this noun was the second declension <i>socer</i>  (nom.), <i>soceri</i>  (gen.). The fourth declension <i>socrus</i>  was almost always feminine, with the meaning ‘mother in law’ (thus in all 19 of Cicero’s uses of <i>socrus</i>). Aside from this verse, the only other two instances of masculine <i>socrus</i>  (to mean ‘father-in-law’) are found in Nonius Marcellus and Priscian, both quotations from early Republican texts from the stage. Nonius Marcellus comments of <i>socrus</i>, <i>socrus et masculine genere ueteres dici posse</i>, and illustrates the unusual form by quoting a verse from Naevius’ Pellicus, a <i>fabula togata</i>  (a comedy ‘in Roman dress’): <i>desim socru tuo, fratri patrueli meo? </i>. Priscian, after offering an example from Juvenal (Sat. 6.231) of the feminine usage, notes: <i>uetustissimi tamen communiter ‘hic’ et ‘haec socrus’ proferebant. Accius in Atreo: simul et Pisaea praemia arrepta a socru (/…) possedit suo</i>. It is worth observing that, as Miskell (1959, 102-3) points out, no manuscripts actually have any evidence for <i>socru</i>, rather it is the product of inference by Bentley, who has been followed by other editors, based on what the grammarians are saying. (It could be the case, however, that the fourth and fifth century grammarians could themselves be using faulty manuscripts, but given the conjecture solves the metrical difficulty, it seems worth adopting.</p>\n<p><b>nanctus]</b>The better manuscripts are divided between <i>nanctus</i> and <i>nactus</i>, both forms appear in Plautus, although <i>nanctus</i> is rarer, and both forms scan identically. Given the slight trend towards <i>nanctus</i> in the manuscripts (in the Gudianus 294 (G) manuscript, the Cambrai manuscript (<i>cod. Cameracensis</i>, K, and in the first hand of the Parisinus Regius 6332 (R) MS, before it was corrected by the second hand, and the principle of <i>lectio difficilior</i> with <i>nanctus</i> being rarer, it makes sense to lean towards that form. There is also a slight syntactical issue that we have no finite verb inside the relative clause introduced by <i>qui</i>. One possibility is that there was originally a cliticized form of nanctus est. Davies conjected <i>nactu’st</i> in , and Tregder <i>nanctust</i> in 1841, both on the basis of the <i>codex Pithoeanus</i> (p), which had the reading <i>nanctus est</i>. The <i>Pithoeanus</i> is a lost manuscript, but its readings were collated in 1597 in an <i>editio Gryphianus</i> of 1535 (cf. Davies (1730) i n.1, Tregder (1841) xii, Giusta (1984) xxiii). However, its readings do not have great weight and it is descended from <i>R</i> and <i>K</i> anyway. Tregder’s suggestion was adopted by Ribbeck, although other editors of the tragic fragments have not sided with a cliticized form. Cliticized forms are prone to be lost in manuscripts, because scribes “rarely comprehended the spelling <i>-st</i>” (Pezzini (2015) 56). Pezzini (2015, 63) places <i>TrRF adesp.</i> 55 in the category of readings where “the reading of manuscripts is often linguistically acceptable and thus the contracted form is less necessary” (p. 61). (And see further Pezzini (2015) esp. 227-231 on the the cliticization of esse.) But, as Jocelyn points out, another Ennian fragment, <i>TrRF</i> 23, contains such an ellipse of <i>est</i> in a relative clause: <i>uidi, uidere quod me passa aegerrume</i>. Thus conjecturing a contracted form is also unnecessary here, and the evidence of the <i>codex Pithoeanus</i> for doing so is weak.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>The two fragments <i>TrRF adesp.</i>  55 and <i>TrRF adesp.</i>  56 are quoted in the same section of Cicero’s <i>Tusculanae Disputationes</i>  (3.26) and Cicero is clearly referring to the same character, i.e. the son of Pelops, <i>Pelope natus</i>.</p>\n<p>Those editors venturing attributions (Colonna, Welcker, Ribbeck, Vahlen, Jocelyn, Warmington, Traglia) all further assume that this son of Pelops is Thyestes (not Atreus, although he was also the son of Pelops and Hippodamia), given the <i>uis sceleris</i> of Fr. 56, a corruption due to a hideous crime, which does indeed seem to fit Thyestes’ fate. Cicero’s point is that grief can obliterate the dignity of a man: the plot of the <i>cena Thyestea</i> would fit this trajectory of a fall from grace. </p>\n<p>A further assumption is that both fragments are not just about Thyestes but also from the same play, Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i>. Cicero might possibly be drawing together references to Thyestes from different plays (e.g. Accius’ Atreus), however, the attribution to Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i> seems the most plausible. </p> \n<p>Ribbeck (1875) thought this fragment occurred prior to the <i>Thyestea cena</i> and connected it with <i>TrRF II inc. 157</i>, <i>pol mihi fortuna</i>, providing Thyestes’ motivation for returning to challenge Atreus and restore his faded fortunes (whereas he located <i>adesp.</i>  56 to the end of the play). Vahlen (1904) also couples these two fragments, but relocates them to after the <i>Thyestea cena</i>, and so instead of the misfortune of exile, it is the misfortune of the feast Thyestes laments. </p> \n<p>Other critics think <i>adesp.</i>  55 and 56 were juxtaposed or closely connected. For instance, Warmington (1935) suggested coupling them, as part of a speech by Thyestes to the chorus (made up of King Thesprotus’ courtiers). Thyestes has arrived in Thesprotus after fleeing Mycenae in the wake of the <i>cena</i>. Thyestes reveals who he is and a warning of the corruption (<i>contagio</i>) that he brings. Jocelyn agrees with joining the two fragments, but since he does not think the <i>cena</i> featured in Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i>, he believes that <i>adesp.</i>  55 also functions as the external audience’s introduction to the character of Thyestes. </p>', 'status': 'Adesp.', 'context': [{'author': 'Cicero', 'location': 'Tusculanae Disputationes', 'text': '<p>Cicero quotes this verse in his <i>Tusculanae Disputationes</i> (3, 26) in the middle of a discussion about grief.

He states that Lycurgus most likely didn’t consider his prisoner to be a God, which is why he makes such severe threats in fragment 21. This obviously implies that he places these two fragments next to each other. Furthermore Klussmann rightly assumes that it’s very likely that Liber wasn’t captured by fight or by ambush but simply surrendered without resisting. Spaltenstein adds to this argument that it would be very likely that the recipient of Lycurgus’ question responded with <i>ni pugna ni dolis</i>, which in return would be a possible explanation for <i>sine ferro ut pecua manibus ut ad mortem meant</i> [F27 TrRF]. He also states that this could be seen as the start of the confrontation between Lycurgus and Liber, since it’s possible for him to ask this question to his guards even after the prisoners have been introduced to him.

In this fragment, it appears as misfortune. <i>Fortuna</i> was always ambiguous: there was a temple to Fortuna Mala on the Esquiline from early on in Rome’s history (see Miano (2018) 114-5. In Plautus’ <i>Asinaria</i>, for instance, Philenium complains of his fortune (Pl. <i>As.</i> 515). Cicero mentions <i>Fortuna</i> as a deity but also states that she be capricious and dangerous (Cic. <i>NatD.</i> 3.24.61). <i>Fortuna is mentioned 4 times in Ennius’ fragments (70, 135, 153 and 157)</i>. Of these 4 fragments, one belongs to <i>Hectoris Lytra</i>, one to <i>Thyestes</i>, and the other two are <i>incerta</i>, but one of them is likely to belong to <i>Thyestes</i> and the other might belong to <i>Hectoris Lytra</i>, depending on how that play is reconstructed.

Manuwald opts for a trochaic septenarius, since she prints <i>eheu</i> (also, for example, Paduano 1974: 48), whereas a iambic senarius hypermetricus is considered possible by Vossius (Vossius 1620: 113).</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>This fragment clearly contains an outcry by a character who feels that everything is going wrong. If we are right to adopt either Vossius’ or Lachmann’s emendation of heu heu or eheu respectively, in the process turning the line into a trochaic septenarius, it was likely to have been voiced by a character entering the stage. The lament is strengthened by the repetitive use of words containing an ‘m’. Several scholars interpret this verse as the words of Thyestes (Ribbeck 1875: 203; Mette 1964: 65; Webster 1967: 114). Boyle, for example, proposes that these lines ‘belong to a lament by Thyestes after discovering that he had raped his own daughter’ (Boyle 2006: 81).</p> <p>Another editor of Ennius’ fragments, Manuel Segura Morena (1984), has compared the invocation of <i>fortuna</i> to the opening line of Enn. inc. frg. 157 (<i>pol mihi fortuna</i>) (a comparison also made by Jocelyn). Morena suggests that the speaker in both fragments could be the same character. In fragment 157, too, <i>fortuna</i> is ‘falling’ on the speaker. In his commentary on this fragment, Jocelyn argues for a linguistic paradox in Ennius’ fragment, since he suggests that calling upon <i>fortuna</i> in republican drama was usually to invoke a positive force. If Jocelyn is right to see this, the theme of a sudden and unexpected change in fortune might have been central to the play. We could draw a comparison with another invocation of <i>fortuna</i> found in republican drama, namely in Terence’s <i>Hecyra</i> (v. 406): <i>O fortuna, ut numquam perpetuo’s data</i> (Jocelyn 1967: 424).</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus', 'location': None, 'text': '<p>As a grammarian, Nonius Marcellus uses the quotation of this verse in order to support his explanation of the world <i>conglomerare</i>, rare in classical Latin, for which he gives two synonyms (<i>involvere</i> and <i>superaddere</i>) before inserting Ennius’ fragment 135.</p>'}], 'lines': [{'line_number': '135', 'text': '⟨e⟩heu mea fortuna ut omnia in me conglomeras mala'}], 'linked_fragments': ['64be547fd24f46f6ac5a29c3e1a2e6e9', 'bc297a94829444fbae3e7b5c87db5ba3', '4717ce4238d94730b099e0ffccddfaeb', 'd2b673d72b884f3cbbe8562e096f9f49'], 'lock': 1, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>

Grotius’ *<i>visceratis</i>, suggested for metrical reasons, is unattested, and also weakens the crescendo in the lines, as the speaker adds increasingly grim detail to their curse.<br>\n <b>tabo, sanie et sanguine atro]</b> “with gore, pus and black blood”. Exactly what fluids tabum and sanies refer to is unclear. The early 1st century AD medical writer Celsus mentions <i>pus</i> in the context of the effects of different kinds of <i>tabes</i>, or wasting diseases, in his <i>De Medicina</i>. Celsus also describes <i>sanies</i> as ‘thinner’ than blood, differing in density, stickiness and colour (<i>sanies est tenuior hoc, uarie crassa et glutinosa et colorata</i>, 5.26.20a.1), while pus is ‘the thickest, whitest substance, stickier than either’ (<i>pus crassissimum albidissimumque, glutinosius et sanguine et sanie</i>, <i>ibid.</i>). Celsus tells us that all three substances, <i>sanguis</i>, <i>sanies</i> and <i>pus</i>, are secreted from wounds, either fresh ones or ones already healing. Virgil refers to <i>sanie taboque fluentis</i> (8.457, ‘as gore and pus flowed’) in the context of Mezentius’ torture of shackling alive prisoners to dead ones, and Virgil’s Acheminides, one of Odysseus’ crewmen, describes to Aeneas and his followers how the Cyclops spilled the fluids (<i>sanies</i>, 3.625) of his crewmates and crushed their limbs dripping with gore (<i>tabum</i>, 3.626) between his teeth. Virgil is also fond of the collocation of <i>sanguis</i> with <i>ater</i> (<i>Georgics</i> 3.221, 3.507-8,<i>Aeneid</i> 3.28, 3.33, 3.622), and later poets such as Ovid and Statius pick up on this.<br>\n<b>quo recipiat]</b> An uncommon intransitive usage otherwise attested only in Plautus (<i>Bacch.</i> 294, <i>rursum in portum recipimus</i>; <i>Rud.</i>  880, <i>dum recipis</i>; <i>Merc.</i>  499, ergo actutum face cum praeda recipias</i>) (cf. Eckert (1849) 37). In later Latin, <i>se</i> is coupled with <i>recipiere</i> in this usage of ‘to withdraw to’ or ‘to retreat to’.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>The lines are a curse sworn by Thyestes upon Atreus, that he would die in a shipwreck, as Cicero tells us in the Tusculans. The first two lines present a rising crescendo. It is hard to say whether the third and fourth lines immediately followed, or if there was intervening speech which Cicero has omitted. In comedy octonarii are comparatively uncommon and follow particular patterns of usage – for instance, octonarii often occur in units of one or two lines and represent moments of heightened emotion before the speaker switches into another metre (see Moore (2012) 178-9). Octonarii can often accompany entrances or exits, but do not have to, and often a speech which began with octanarii before a switch to another metre can return to octonarii for one line and then a new metre (cf. Pl. <i>Hec.</i> 516-534). If Ennius’ tragic usage mirrored Plautus’ comic usage of the metre, then we should not necessarily assume that the first two lines of <i>TrRF</i> were opening lines, but were rather punctuating a speech full of angry emotion, which is also reflected in the strong and violent language of the lines.<br>\nThe criticism that Cicero levels at Thyestes’ sentiments, that Pelops should have better educated his son that the body was insensate upon death, and therefore that Atreus’ body might lack a tomb ought to be of irrelevance to Atreus, in fact rather shows the importance that was placed in Roman society upon a good burial.<br>\nPrecisely the occasion for this curse is not totally clear. Horace in <i>Ep.</i> 5 mentions <i>Thyesteas preces</i>. The grammarian Porphyrio commented of <i>preces</i>: <i>id est: diras exsecrationes, qualibus in tragoediis Thyestes Atreum exsecratur</i> (Porph. <i>ad Hor. Ep.</i> 5.86). And another scholiast narrowed down the window even more specifically: <i>diras. et tales infossus puer, ait, preces coepit effundere, quales in tragoediis inducitur Thyestes cognitis filii membris in Atreum locutus.</i> ([Acron] <i>ad Hor. Ep.</i> 5.86). In Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i>, the last act contains the revelation of the truth of the <i>cena</i> and after learning the truth, in a long prayer Thyestes initially calls out to the heavens that either both of them should be killed (1087-8), or if only one, that he, Thyestes, suffer Zeus’ lightning bolt (1088-92). But then Atreus continues taunting him and Thyestes does state briefly that his prayers seek Atreus’ punishment too (1110-1). Seneca’s Thyestes, however, is likely reacting to exactly the kinds of <i>preces</i> uttered by Thyestes in earlier tragedies – and these could well be in Sophocles’ <i>Thyestes</i> as well as Ennius’ and Accius’ versions – where Thyestes invoked simpler curses upon Atreus, the kinds of <i>preces</i> alluded to by Horace. The <i>preces</i> seem well-known enough as an emotional climax in such plays to sustain the Horatian allusion, but it’s still worth noting that Accius’ and Sophocles’ versions would be sufficient to justify the phrase <i>in tragoediis</i> used by the ancient Horatian commentators, if Ennius’ play did not include the feast, as in Jocelyn’s hypothesis.<br>\nBoth Jocelyn (1967, 415) and Boyle (2006, 81) imagine Thyestes uttering the curses in the presence of some third party, not in Atreus’ presence. Jocelyn suggests that if Thyestes had been cursing Atreus while in exile in Thesprotus, hearing that Atreus was setting out in pursuit from Mycene, there would be added piquancy, since Atreus could be expected to sail across the sea from the Peloponnese to find him. But then again, a death through being dashed upon rocks by the sea would be quite appropriate for a member of the house of Pelops to recall anyway: according to the mythographers Ps.-Apollodorus and Hyginus, Pelops threw the charioteer Mytilus (with whom he had been in league to kill king Oenamaus) from a cliff into the sea (Ps.-Apoll. <i>Epit.</i> 2.7-8, Hyg. <i>Fab.</i> 84, cf. also Eur. <i>Or.</i> 990-991, Μυρτίλου φόνον δικὼν ἐς οἶδμα πόντου. Still, Cicero does make mention of <i>naufragium</i>, which does add an element of plot connection to Jocelyn’s suggestion. Ultimately, the question of when these prayers were uttered depends on other elements in the plot reconstruction.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': None, 'location': None, 'text': '<p>The fragment is quoted by Cicero in <i>In Pisonem</i> 43 and <i>Tusculanae disputationes</i> 1, 107 and by Nonius Marcellus 651 Li. In <i>In Pisonem</i>, Cicero quotes the fragment in the context of a discussion on the definition of punishment (<i>poena</i>); he states that something is only a punishment if the person it is inflicted on is guilty, so not every disaster that happens to someone is a punishment. A good person, according to philosophers, can still be happy even though he or she is being tortured. So Cicero does not simply pray to the gods for disaster to strike his opponents, the way he claims Thyestes does in the fragment; instead, he wishes for them to be punished for their sins, which can also consist in harm to their reputations. (Cicero, <i>In Pisonem</i> 42-44.) Note that Cicero does not attribute the lines to Ennius in this passage, only to Thyestes as its speaker.</p> <p>The passage in the <i>Tusculanae disputationes</i> is part of a larger discussion about death and why it should not be feared. Cicero quotes the fragment, which he attributes to Ennius this time, and comments that the curse would have been grave if Atreus (whom he names as the target of the curse) would still be able to feel the things Thyestes wished upon him; however, in reality, he would never experience hanging from a rock and being left unburied, because he would already be dead at the time and therefore would not feel anything (Cicero, <i>Tusculanae disputationes</i> 1, 107). The third and fourth lines of the fragment are quoted only in this passage, and separately from the first two. Therefore, we should not assume that lines 3 and 4 directly followed line 2 in Ennius’ text: there could have been lines between lines 2 and 3 of the fragment which Cicero did not quote. For this reason, Ribbeck and others insert a lacuna between the second and third line of the fragment (e.g. Mueller 1884, 121, Ribbeck 1897, 68, Ernout 1966, 191-192).</p> <p>Nonius, finally, quotes the fragment to explain the word <i>spargere</i>, which he defines as <i>madefacere</i> (“to make wet”). Notably, he does not attribute the fragment to Ennius, but to Lucilius’ 24<sup>th</sup> book. If Lucilius indeed wrote these same words, it seems likely that he was quoting Ennius and Nonius did not realise this.

Junius and Vossius have transmitted <i>cum</i>. Several editors have taken over this change, like Dangel, D’Anto and Ribbeck<sub>2</sub>. They think the line is part of a dependent clause, which gives more information about the (temporal) circumstances of the main verb or is used in cases where the speaker is involved in the main verb of the independent clause. It is also possible to read <i>cum</i> as a preposition in D’Anto’s suggestion Some editors stick with <i>tum</i>, for example Ribbeck<sub>3</sub> and Warmington. Ribbeck<sub>3</sub> combines <i>tum</i> with <i>subinde</i>. The line then becomes an enumeration and follows up on an action mentioned before. Warmington makes a conditional clause out of the line with <i>tum si</i>.</p>\n\n<p><b> dolore]</b> The word <i> dolor </i> can indicate physical pain as well as emotional pain, like grief, see s.v. dolor in OLD. Wilson (2013, 130) states that there are two words to indicate pain in Latin, namely <i>dolor</i> and <i>cruciatus</i>. According to Wilson, although <i>dolor</i> does not make a distinction between physical and emotional pain and should be interpreted from the context, <i>cruciatus</i> indicates a physical pain, caused by torture. The <i>OLD</i>, however, indicates that <i> cruciatus </i> does not only indicate physical pain caused by a disease or accident, but that it can also be used to refer to mental pain, see s.v. <i>cruciatus</i> in <i> OLD </i>. See also Cicero <i> Tusculanis Disputationis</i>II.XV.35-36 for the distinction between <i>dolor</i> and <i>labor</i>.\n<p><b> subito e deliro]</b> Since <i> dolor</i> can refer to different kinds of pain, Wilson (2013, 140) states that it is necessary to use the context to determine the nature of the pain and that the pain is often specified by an adjective, a ‘qualifier’. In this fragment, it is difficult to determine the context due to the textcritical problem. Manuscripts have transmitted <i>subidae/sibidae/subito deloidelore</i>. Editors have made some suggestions for alternative readings. Ribbeck has specified the pains in two ways. In his second edition, he reads <i>sub crudelei dolore</i>. A possible interpretation is then pain deriving from torture. In his third edition, however, he reads <i>levi dolore</i>. D’Anto also refers to the pain als ‘light’. Although the adjective provides a bit more context, it is still unsure if the body in question will experience physical or emotional/mental pain. The suggestion also seems less likely with regard to the plot, provided by Hyginus in <i>Fabulae</i> 132 and Diodorus Siculus in <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i> III.65. Warmington does not read an adjective here. Dangel suggests <i>deliro</i> and interprets the pain as a ‘mental pain’. This would be in line with Diodorus Siculus’ version of the story.</p>\n<p><b>hoc]</b> The <i>hoc</i> can indicate several things, s.v. <i>hoc</i> in the <i>OLD</i>. The speaker might refer to someone nearby. This means that there is another person on stage to whom the speaker directs his words. Of course, it might refer to someone who is not present on stage but has been mentioned in the previous lines. However, <i>hoc</i> can also refer to the speaker himself or parts of his body. This means that the speaker would refer with <i>hoc corpus</i> to his own body. Thus, the speaker would be the one to undergo the pain.</p>\n<p><b>liquerit]</b> can be either 3rd sg. fut. ex. ind. act. or 3rd sg. perf. subj. act. According to Kühner and Stegman (1955, 147), the <i>futurum exactum</i> occurs often in simple indepedent clauses to indicate the determined result of the future action, especially in Roman comedies. Because of the uncertainty about <i>cum/tum</i> it is not possible to say with certainty if the line is part of the dependent or independent clause.  Yet, the <i>futurum exactum</i> indicates that the speaker talks about an event that will be completed in the future, in this case, someone will be dead. If we read <i>liquerit</i> as a subjunctive, the line indicates circumstances under which or by which the action of the independent clause has happened. The use of the perfect in the dependent clause, indicates that the main verb of the independent clause is either a present indicative, future indicative, or a future perfect indicative. The speaker possibly talks about a certain action, which takes or will take place after someone’s death.</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>The fragment has been attributed by Nonius to Accius’ <i>Stasiastae</i>. There are some textcritical problems with the beginning of the line. However, we can conclude that the speaker speaks of or predicts someone’s death. It is possible that the speaker addresses someone on stage, because of the use of <i>hoc</i>, which indicates closeness. Yet, it is also possible that the speaker talks about someone who has been mentioned before or that he speaks of his own death. </p>\n<p>It is likely that the line refers to Lycurgus’ punishment and his death. A possible speaker is Dionysus, who predicts or talks of his revenge on Lycurgus. What kind of punishment is ambiguous. It is possible the speaker (Dionysus) refers to Lycurgus who will be tortured and crucified (Diodor. Sic. III.65), which Warmington suggests. It might also refer to Lycurgus’ death after he has gone mad (Hyginus 132). Dangel seems to attribute the line to this context. Moreover, it is possible that the line is part of Dionysus oracle prediction to the Edonians that the barren Thracian land will only become fertile again, when Lycurgus has been killed (Apollodorus III.5.1). Another option, but less likely, is that the speaker is one of the Edonians, who explains Dionysus wish to kill Lycurgus. </p>\n<p>The line could also be attributed to Lycurgus. He might plot the death of Dionysus (Diodor. Sic. III.65). The fragment would then belong more to the beginning of the play. It seems unlikely that Lycurgus would have someone else in mind, except for Dionysus. Although he kills in some versions of the story his wife and son Dryas, the words <i>anima</i> and <i>corpus</i>, would indicate that Lycurgus is aware of what is happening and that he knows he kills a human instead of branch of vines. The versions of Apollodorus and Hyginus indicate that Lycurgus was either driven mad or intoxicated when he committed these crimes. There is also the possibility that Lycurgus speaks of his own death. This would, however, refute the reading of Dangel’s <i>e deliro dolore</i>, since Lycurgus seems to foresee what will happen.</p>\n<p> It cannot be excluded that the line belongs to a messenger, since the verb <i>liquerit</i> can also be read as a perfective subjunctive and the line speaks of someone’s death, a violent act, which was (probably) not performed on stage.

It can also be Pylades who pretends to be a shepherd, to further the plan of Orestes to avenge the death of his father. In this scenario, Orestes could present himself as Pylades’ assistant (thereby possibly explaining the title Dulorestes). If these two were pretending to be shepherds, this fragment does not necessarily need to be placed at the beginning of the play, for this verse could also be spoken to Clytemnestra and/or Aegisthus, when either of them questions them on their motives for their presence. Schierl thinks that the trip to Delphi of the ‘farmer’ is related to the plot of the rest of the play.

Different editors and scholars have proposed different metric forms and, in some cases, different arrangement of the verses.

However, it could also indicate the <i>posturing</i>, according to Warmington. Naevius, instead of making use of the <i>schema, schemae</i> (f) chooses to follow the greek form <i>σχῆμα, σχήματος</i> (n): schema, schematis (n), which indicates a discourse with greek tragedy and, perhaps, points back to the second given meaning of the word.</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>This fragment requires a group of Bacchants, to which it refers to. According to Spaltenstein, it indicates, along with fr. 31, 25, 23 the existence of a chorus in <i>Lycurgus</i>. Accius’ <i>Stasiastae</i> also features a chorus, but one that consists of followers of Lycurgus. On the other hand, Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i> involves a feminine chorus of Bacchants and, maybe, this is also the case for Naevius’ <i> Lycurgus</i> (Spaltenstein, §1243).</p>\n<p>Concerning the speaker, Marmorale, Traglia and Klussmann believe that it is Bacchus who encourages the Bacchants, while for Warmington the chorus speaks these words, encouraging itself. However, accepting the chorus as the speaker here, the meter (ia<sup>6</sup>) he proposes contradicts the Greek tradition according to Spaltenstein (§1244), except if they are the coryphe’s words, speaking in between chorus’ songs.</p>\n<p>Ancient scholars, as well as Ribbeck (1875), have analyzed this fragment as part of the attack to the Bacchants. Similarly, Klussmann thinks that Bacchus addresses these words to the Bacchants, encouraging them to attack Lycurgus (cf Eur. <i>Bacch.</i> 733, 763sqq), not with weapons, but with their thyrsi, <i>Bacchico cum schemate</i>. However, Spaltenstein (§1241) argues that the battle could not be staged, but just narrated, so he considers the previous interpretations improbable. Ribbeck (1875) believes that these words urge the chorus to dance and assumes its entry on the stage (cf. Eur. <i>Bacch.</i> 83). Warmington also suggests that, at this point, the chorus sings as it enters, attributing the verse to the coryphe encouraging it.</p>\n<p>Finally, the most persuading speculation seems to be the one of Spaltenstein (§1245); the fragment is part of the orders of the coryphe or the god, encouraging the chorus of Bacchants, while pointing out their particular clothing or behavior (<i>schemate</i>), probably as they enter the stage for the first time.</p>\n', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina', 'text': '<p>Nonius Marcellus quotes the line from <i>Lycurgus</i> discussing the grammatical gender of the word schema: </p><p> schema feminino genere dici veterum usurpat auctoritas.</p><p>Plautus Amphitryone:</p><p>quod ego huc processi sic cum servili schema.</p> <p>Pomponius Prostibulo:</p><p>si valebit, plus in buccam baetet siticinis / schema</p><p>Neutro Naevius Lycurgo:</p><p><b>pergite,</p><p>thyrsigerae Bacchae modo, Bacchico cum schemate.</b> (Non. 333 Li.)</p>'}], 'lines': [{'line_number': '1', 'text': 'pergite,'}, {'line_number': '2', 'text': 'thyrsigerae Bacchae modo, Bacchico cum schemate'}], 'linked_fragments': [], 'lock': 0, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>

Lindsay suggested <i>uitale</i>to agree with the hypothesis of a neuter noun </i>brabium</i>. <i>vitalem</i> has also been questioned as part of the textual corruption, for instance by Jocelyn. See further the commentary and the reconstruction</p>', 'commentary': '<b>impetrem facile ab animo]</b> The obscurity of the second half of the line makes the first half difficult to interpret as well. Warmington adopts Quicherat’s conjectured addition of <i>meo</i> with <i>ab animo</i> and takes it with the second half of the line, translating ‘May I with ease cause him to adjudge the vital prize to my liking’. However, Jocelyn found a parallel for <i>impetrare ab animo ut</i> in Livy (<i>AUC</i> 43.24.8), where it means ‘to prevail upon oneself to...’ and pointed out other uses of <i>impetrare</i> + <i>ab</i> found in Cicero’s letters (<i>Fam.</i>) 8.12.1) and Petronius (<i>Sat.</i> 52.5). If Jocelyn is right, one could translate ‘May I easily prevail upon (my) mind to contest the vital prize’ (if adopting <i>brabium</i> as below). But perhaps in context the <i>animo</i> belonged to a second person who was being addressed, or a third person who was offstage.  <p><b>uitalem babium]</b> There is no evidence for what uitalem babium might mean, but the suggestion by Lindsay, followed by Warmington, that they might be a corruption of <i>uitale brabium </i> is quite attractive. The word is otherwise unattested in Latin, but it could be a loan-word modelled by Ennius on <i>brabeion</i>, originally used of the prize in athletic contests. The Greek word is found in Menander (<i>Mon.</i> 653) but is only found with relative frequency in inscriptions and New Testament texts of the 1st and 2nd century AD. The word might have been in everyday usage, and so Ennius might have used it precisely because although it had colloquial overtones, but on the other hand the lack of evidence for it even in more colloquial literary genres like comedy perhaps should discount that possibility.', 'reconstruction': '<p> The reconstruction of fragment 139 within the <i>Thyestes</i> is hard because of the corruption of this line. The lack of information about the context, the speaker but also the metre or the meaning of this line make it impossible to say anything conclusive about this line.</p>Ribbeck has another reading: <i>impetrem fac facile, ab animo ut cernat vitalem abigeum</i> (‘easily I get, what he from the mind judges a vital cattle-stealer’) and he names Thyestes as the speaker and places the fragment in the beginning of the tragedy as part of a prayer in a monologue (Ribbeck 1875, 200).</p><p>If <i>brabium</i> is indeed the word that lies behind the corrupted text, then this prompts some thought over who might discuss a ‘prize’ or view events of the plot in terms of an athletic metaphor. The corruption has led to many suggestions about the precise wording, the speaker and the place within the play. Boyle, for example, suggests <i>vitale brabium</i> (‘vital prize’) as possible correction (Boyle 2006, 82-83). He infers from this version of the fragment that the ‘vital prize’ might be Pelopia. However, he does not name a possible speaker and he concludes his interpretation by stating it is a “complete guess” (Boyle 2006, 82-83). Actually, in Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i> Atreus does precisely this. At <i>Thy.</i> 1097 he declares himself the winner of the <i>palma</i>, the palm wreath awarded to victorious athletes. And earlier in the play, he declared his intention to be ‘first’ to do harm to his brother (before Thyestes could hurt him), <i>aut perdet aut peribit: in medio est scelus / positum occupanti</i>, “either he will destroy or be destroyed: inbetween us is the crime, for whoever gets to it first” (<i>Thy.</i> 204-5). For Seneca’s Atreus, he is in a race with Thyestes for revenge. Seneca’s Thyestes, on the other hand, shows no cognizance of this situation. Could Ennius’ Atreus also thought of himself in a life-or-death struggle with his brother? This would make some sense of the expression <i>uitale brabium</i>. The line would then be part of Atreus’ self-encouragement to himself towards his cruelty to Thyestes, convincing himself of the necessity of his actions, in a speech similar to those aforementioned lines from the second act of Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i> or the words of Accius’ Atreus (<i>Atreus</i> 29-32 Dangel).', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus', 'location': '261.13-17', 'text': '<p> The quoting author is grammarian Nonius Marcellus.

As Manuwald points out, it is possible that the <i>s</i> was written by someone who thought that Thyestes must have been the person speaking without paying attention to the sentence structure (Manuwald 2015, 9). It is very unlikely that the manuscripts that carry the division <i>Thyestes et</i> do actually record the speaker, given that, although speakers are indicated in the papyri which transmit 5th century Greek tragedy and in the medieval manuscripts of Senecan tragedy, it would be peculiar for Nonius to include such an indication, since it is beside his purposes and at odds with the rest of his practice. Hypothetically, even if the line was copied from a papyrus and the speaker indication accidentally included, it would still be very strange for the full name to be written out in full in the papyrus, rather than an abbreviation. If a scribe copied the indication of the speaker name in full, we would assume that the line is the beginning of the speech, and a new character is entering the stage, otherwise we would expect the name to be abbreviated. The language of the line (in this case, <i>et me Apollo</i>, however, does not fit very well for the beginning to a speech. If <i>Thyeste</i> is part of Nonius' introduction, and <i>set</i> the first word of the line, the spelling of <i>set</i> is possible but rather unusual. Of course, the rarity might have confused a scribe. Some editors have followed Scriverius' conjecture <i>sed</i>, with this suggestion the scribe still became confused and made <i>Thyeste</i> a nominative, and then the <i>ed</i> that was left from the changed word division was corrected to <i>et</i>.

According to the account in Hyginus’ <i>Fabulae</i>, the line could be attributed to Thyestes referring the oracle which said he would have a child with his own daughter (Hyg. <i>Fab</i>. 87) or to Atreus, who received an oracle telling him to invite his brother back to stop the drought in Mycenae while Thyestes was in Epirus (Hyg. <i>Fab.</i>. 88).</p><p>The occasion of the performance of Ennius’ play was the <i>Ludi Apollini</i> (Cic. <i>Brut.</i>78 [= Manuwald <i>TrRF</i> T 20]), the festival sacred to Apollo, which might explain why Ennius might have linked Thyestes so closely to the god.</p> <p>The metre of the line as transmitted in the manuscripts is lyric, which might suggest that it was spoken either by the chorus or, more uniquely, at Delphi by Apollo’s priest, possessed by the god himself (so the fragment would have functioned as the oracle introducing the prophetic words themselves). A staging of the Delphic oracle in Ennius’ play might reflect growing Roman fascination with Delphi - Livy mentions a number of significant embassies from Rome to Delphi in the period contemporary to the likely performance of Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i> (<i>AUC</i> 41.25, 45.41), which was part of Rome’s involvement in the Greek political sphere. Livy also recounts famous Roman consultations with the Delphic oracle from early in Rome’s history, in the time of the monarchy (1.56) and the fledging Republic (5.15-6) and during the second Punic War. (Furthermore, if the speaker is a Delphic priest, then the relationship expressed between her and the god Apollo would be exceptional. Scenes of divine possession and compulsion and oracular speech by Apollo are common in later Latin literature, but none express the same pleasure that the speaker of this lines takes in their possession. In Virgil’s <i>Aeneid</i> 6.77ff., the contact between the Sibyl and Apollo is depicted as a battle of wills;  Lucan’s Delphic priestess Phemonoe (Luc. <i>BC</i> 5.66ff.) is terrified of the god <i>pavidamque… vatem</i>, 124); and Cassandra in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i> is not pleased at being possessed, but in the vision she is shown of Agamemnon’s murder. Given the caveat that the line would be unusual if ascribed to a Delphic priestess, then the arguments for attributing the line to one of the brothers recalling the words of Apollo could be plausible (Welcker thought they were Thyestes’ words, Jocelyn that they were either Thyestes’ words about the oracle about his daughter or the words of Atreus about the oracle telling him to recall Thyestes from exile) - however, the lyric metre is less likely to be appropriate, making the adoption of the conjecture <i>ipsus</i> to render the line a trochaic septenarius more appealing.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus', 'location': '97.29-30', 'text': '<p>The fragment is quoted by Nonius Marcellus, 97.29-30 (ed.

The passage, at least as Cicero and the author of Ad Herennium present it, is an example of bad argumentation, where something is taken for granted which should not be (see also Quoting Author section). Within this context, a scribe might easily believe he (mis)hears the word studii in the sounds of tu dii.</P>', 'commentary': '<b>eho]</b> This interjection is more commonly found in early Roman comedy. However, its appearance in this Ennian tragic fragment (regardless of whether Crephontes or Thesprotum is the speaker) underlines the overlap in language between comedy and tragedy on the Roman stage, more than on the fifth century Athenian stage.\n<b>motus]</b> motus (=mōtūs) is a genitive governed by potestas (=mōtūs). Although the form motum is present in multiple codices, neither an accusative noun or participle form (of moveo) would fit into the syntax of this verse, so this must be interpreted as a genitive plural. Either variant could have easily developed from the other by scribal error. It is difficult to pick one over the other, and it makes no real difference to the interpretation.\n<b>superum atque inferum]</b> <i>superi</i> usually refers to the gods; <i>inferi</i> to the dead or the inhabitants of the underworld. However, since the <i>di</i> are addressed, <i>superi</i> must either refer to ‘lesser’ deities, or be a polar opposite of <i>inferi</i>, ‘creatures above’ versus ‘creatures below’.</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>The fragment starts with a direct exclamation, which orders the addressee to listen carefully to what the speaker(s) has to say. This interjection is followed by a statement about the gods, who have power over everything and are able to reconcile with one another, thereby creating harmony out of conflict. We can conclude that the speaker is directly addressing someone on stage who has been quarrelling with another character, after which the speaker states that even the all-powerful gods are able to reconcile with one another. It seems unlikely that the speaker has a conflict with the addressee, because the verses seem to be spoken as ‘some words of wisdom’ to the latter.</p>\n<p>The surrounding context of the passage in the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i> provides us with some possible identifications of the speaker and addressee. As discussed in the passage above, the speaker in this fragment can be identified as Thesprotus or Cresphontes because both names appear in various codices of the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i>.</p> \n<p>Based on the reading of the name Thesprotus in this text, Vahlen, Warmington, Zillinger, Traglia and Boyle assign the fragment to Ennius’ Thyestes. Their argument is largely based on the assumption that the Thyestes was set at Thesprotus’ court, which played a fundamental part in the story about the feud between Atreus and Thyestes. If this attribution of the fragment is accepted, we can identify the speaker as Thesprotus, reflecting on the feud between Thyestes and Atreus. This then makes it likely that Thyestes is the addressee, and Thesprotus is advising resolving the feud in the wake of the Thyestean feast. Whether or not Thesprotus (or Thyestes) is aware of the oracle which predicts how he will be revenged, is unclear. It seems that Thesprotus is a naive character, to believe that Thyestes’ and Atreus’ quarrel can be amicably resolved - this seems to be what the author of the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i> and Cicero suggest.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Welcker and Ribbeck have argued that we should read the name Cresphontes in the Rhetorica ad Herennium and ascribe the fragment to Ennius’ Cresphontes. They assume that Cresphontes the Elder is the speaker and this fragment can be placed after he conquered the Peloponnese and gained control of the city Messenia. The statement in the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium</i> might then refer to Cresphontes, who will later be killed by the usurper Polyphontes. Wecklein furthermore suggests reading Polyphontes instead of Cresphontes as the character attributed the lines. Based on this reading, Mette has argued that Polyphontes is the speaker and the wife of the murdered Cresphontes the Elder, Meropa, is the addressee. However, if the Ennian play used the same plot as Euripides’ play of the same name, as most other scholars have assumed, it would have dealt with the revenge of Cresphontes the Younger, the son of the aforementioned Chresphontes, on Polyphontes and the recovering of his father’s kingdom.</p>\n<p>A case can be made for either of the two plays but the fact that the name Thesprotus appears in multiple codices (instead of Cresphontes in just one manuscript) favours an attribution to the Thyestes. However, since the title of the Ennian play isn’t quoted by the authors, Manuwald’s solution to place the fragment under the Incerta is equally plausible, albeit a bit cautious.</p>', 'status': 'Incertum', 'context': [{'author': None, 'location': None, 'text': '<p>The fragment above is quoted two times, once by the anonymous author of the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium </i> (<i>Rhet.

In this passage on defective arguments, the author of the <i>Rhetorica ad Herennium </i>and Cicero discuss how the argument presented by an orator can be refuted when the proof he applies to support his reasoning is incorrect. To illustrate their point, both authors cites the two verses quoted above as an example of such a defective argument. The <i>Auct. ad. Her. </i> (in contrast with Cicero) adds that Thesprotus must be the speaker <i>(Threprotum Ennius induxit) </i> and claims that Thesprotus’ words insufficiently proof the point the character is trying to make in the play (sc. that the gods would intervene and settle conflict). Scholars who attribute the frg. to Ennius’ <i>Thyestes </i>,  must therefore assume that the play was set at the court of king Thesprotus in Sicyon.  Yet, although the name Thesprotus is transmitted in most <i> codices </i>, the name Cresphontes is also present in some manuscripts. (See Manuwald 2012, 277 n. 277, for an overview of the different codices and variants of the name of the character).

Therefore, it is possible that the words are spoken in a dialogue between Electra and Clytemnestra or Aegisthus, see also Warmington frg.130, D’Anna 1967, 204 and Ribbeck 2013, 245. The second option focuses on the doubt of the speaker. The attitude towards the dialogue partner is in comparison with the subjunctive indignationis more neutral. The speaker asks for advice. In that case, Ribbeck (2013, 245) proposes the possibility that a dialogue between Orestes and Electra takes place, in which a yet unrecognized Orestes tries to comfort Electra. Schierl (2006, 252) also suggests that the line is part of a dialogue on the revenge plans of Orestes and Electra.</p> \n', 'reconstruction': '<p> The speaker asks the question what he or she can say, if someone reviles him with a certain insult. It is not clear how the question should be interpreted. Although the subjunctive can be interpreted as a deliberative, it seems more likely that the question here is rhetorical or expresses a certain irony. It is probable that the question is part of dialogue. The speaker has probably received certain insults from the conversation partner and shows with the rhetorical question that he/she is not affected by the insults. The line might have occurred in a dialogue between Electra or Clytemnestra. It cannot be determined which of the two characters might have insulted the other. Schierl connects the fragments to a dialogue between Electra and Clytemnestra on Electra’s or Erigone’s wedding to Oiax, because the word <i>incilare</i> occurs in a similar context in the Accius’ <i>Clytemnestra</i>.

Here it is certainly used exclusively in a figurative meaning, see further Kruschwitz (2009: 161). By employing the metaphor of a ‘ruminating cow’, the line seems to imply, through its prohibition on further rumination, that <i>haece</i> refers to something ‘that ought to be digested by now (unless one is a silly cow, so to speak)’, see Kruschwitz (2009: 163).</p>\n<p><b>mulieri</b> <i>mulier</i> refers to an adult woman, but unlike <i>uxor</i>, not necessarily to a married one. Therefore, mulier can refer to Clytemnestra as well as Electra, Chrysothemis or Cassandra, see Wessels (2018: 349-350), or the line is a general remark which extends to any woman. <i>mulier</i> seems distancing, and, therefore, presumably is not part of <i>vostrum</i>.</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>The speaker of this verse advises a group of at least two other people (<i>vostrum</i>) to avoid bringing up something that is present or known to them (<i>haece</i>) to a woman (<i>mulieri</i>). <i>Haece</i> presumably refers to things that are troubling or traumatizing for the <i>mulier</i>, but which she already knows but has forgotten. The speaker is possibly portrayed as quite sensitive towards <i>mulier</i> (cf. Ribbeck 1875: 30), but it is also possible that the line concerns a somewhat disrespectful or shameful business familiar to the speaker and the people referred to by <i>vostrum</i>, not to be brought in front of the <i>mulier</i>.</p> \n<p>Agamemnon might be the speaker of the line. Ribbeck suggests that echoes of this line of Livius are found in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>, in Agamemnon’s care for Cassandra (esp. 800-801 <i>Hanc, fida famuli turba, dum excutiat deum, | retinete, ne quid impotens peccet furor</i>). On Ribbeck’s interpretation of Livius’ line, the <i>mulier</i> is Cassandra and Agamemnon is instructing the Chorus not to remind her of the fate of Troy. There are some problems with Ribbeck’s view: in Seneca, Agamemnon is concerned with bringing Cassandra out of her trance, so that she does not say any more worrying prophecies for his future - his care is not for her wellbeing, but his own state of mind. Seneca’s Agamemnon also does not give any instruction about what the chorus are or are not to say to Cassandra, only instructions such as carrying her off or splashing her with cold water. And his addressees are not one of the two (female) choruses (Argive women and Trojan captives) but some non-speaking male slaves (<i>famuli</i> 787, 800).</p>\n<p>A case can be made that Agamenon is the speaker, but the <i>mulier</i> referred to is Clytemnestra. In this case, <i>haece</i> could refer to a number of shameful or problematic prior events, such as the sacrifice of Iphigenia or his adultery with Briseis. As Spaltenstein (2008: 44) remarks, it is impossible that Clytemnestra would have forgotten the sacrifice of Iphigenia. It could be, however, that Agamemnon still tries to prevent Clytemnestra from being reminded of it after his return, and tries to suppress this memory, see Spaltenstein (2008: 44): ‘mais Agamemnon aurait-il, dans le context de son retour triumphal, des raisons de dire à son entourage de ne pas réveiller ce souvenir chez sa femme?’. On the other hand, <i>haece</i> could refer to the sexual relationships by Agamemnon with Chryseis, Briseis and Cassandra, of which Clytemnestra should not be reminded, cf. Spaltenstein (2008: 45). Both of these motives feature in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>: in Clytemestra’s dialogue with the nurse, 164-191 (<i>revolvit animus…</i> , 164) Clytemestra mentions Iphigenia’s sacrifice, and Chryseis, Briseis and Cassandra (which, from Clytemnestra’s perspective, are love affairs, cf. <i>amore captae captus</i>, 175).</p>\n<p>Alternately, Aegisthus or Clytemnestra could be the speakers, which would point to Electra being the <i>mulier</i>. In this case, <i>haece</i> would refer to Agamemnon’s murder, and the instruction would presumably be made to a chorus, or to any servants. If <i>TrRF</i> 2 was interpreted as part of a dialogue between Aegisthus or Clytemnestra and Electra, then this line, on the aforementioned interpretation, could also form part of that scenario, as words perhaps addressed to the chorus after Electra has left the stage.</p>\n<p>Spaltenstein suggests an interpretation that Electra is the speaker of this verse, and that she is urging a group of people (presumably of Argive women) not to say anything about Orestes’ escape with Strophius, see Spaltenstein (2008: 45). This would parallel the scene in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>, where Clytemnestra forces Electra to tell where Orestes went (965-966 <i>citius interea mihi | edissere ubi sit natus, ubi frater tuus</i>; 968 <i>Quo latitat loco?</i>) after he had been saved by Strophius (Sen. <i>Ag</i>. 910-943). However, this impossibly strains the meaning of <i>ruminetur</i>, since Clytemnestra has not heard it and it is not something traumatic.</p>\n<p>Although Chrysothemis does not appear in Aeschylus’ or Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>, rather featuring only in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i> (which dramatises the later events of Orestes’ return to Mycenae to revenge his father). But we do not know how much of the myth Livius included in <i>Aegisthus</i>: he could have included subsequent events in the myth, or intervening material which is not included in other depictions, such as the aftermath of Aegisthus’ and Clytemnestra’s coup. In Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i> Chrysothemis begs the chorus to keep silent about Electra’s intended plans, see Soph. <i>El</i>. 469-471 σιγὴ παρ᾽ὑμῶν πρὸς θεῶν ἔστω, φίλαι· | ὡς εἰ τάδ᾽ἡ τεκοῦσα πεύσεται, πικρὰν | δοκῶ με πεῖραν τήνδε τολμήσειν ἔτι. But the same issue applies in this instance too: <i>ruminari</i> does not seem to fit a secret which should not be divulged, but rather a trauma which should not be brought up again.</p>\n<p>Wessels (2018: 350) raises the possibility to read Cassandra as the <i>mulier</i>, since the line ‘suggests that the female character is either particularly vulnerable or energetic [my own translation from Dutch original – WvD]’. She sees this as a possible indication to argue in favour of Cassandra. This would explain the choice for <i>mulieri</i> instead of <i>uxori</i>, which does not necessarily refer to a married woman (see commentary).</p>\n<p>Ribbeck (4/8) and Warmington (3/8) all place this fragment at the beginning towards the middle of the tragedy.

Why should an expression of politeness find itself in an argument? It signifies that the relations of speaker and interlocutor are strained, and that the motive for discussion must be breached, if at all, under the guise of sympathy or insincere cordiality. The repetition of this oro in the preceding fragment thus hints at the necessary exercise of this sociality.\n\n<p>✝<i>mi</i>✝: In principle, there is nothing unusual about the syncope of the dative singular pronoun. It appears in the works of other poems (for instance in Catullus 5, <i>Da mi basia mille, deinde centum</i>). Ribbeck assumed ✝mi✝ ne reflected an earlier <i>minime</i>. For a detailed discussion of this conjecture and of this fragment’s editorial history, see Schierl (2006), 254. \n\n<p><i>fandi</i>: the appearance here of the participle fandus, ‘which is to be spoken’, is again suggestive of the discretion needed to approach strained an while sustaining an appearance of well-meaning sympathies. The avoidance of implying what exactly ‘must be spoken’ must be of much importance, suggesting, naturally, the murder of Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra’s marriage to Aegisthus. In the Electra of Sophocles, there are prolonged references to the prolixity of the eponymous character and her insistence of speaking of her father’s death (Sophocles, Electra 86-120, 129-36, 213-20; note her ‘countless laments’ at 232f., ἀνάριθμος θρήνων). \n\n<p> prolixitudine: The case and number of this item corresponds to that of vanitudine, located in a verse immediately preceding fr.93, as arranged by Ribbeck3, D’Anna (1955) and Schierl (2006). The similarity of these verses, each initiated by a demand (<i>oro</i>…) and an insult, hints at contrasting views successively spoken in a stichomythia. Prolixity, as Nosarti (1999), 106 argues in his interpretation of the fragment, has pejorative connotations of excess and verbosity. Thus, this word shows us the attitude of one of the speakers of this supposed stichomythia, the need for directness and for the elucidation of ‘those things which must be spoken’, <i>fandi</i>. ', 'reconstruction': 'It has been argued in the commentary that the structural similarity of fr.93 and fr.92 suggest they appeared close to one another in a stichomythia. Another factor, though necessarily indirect, is the assumption that Nonius often has recourse to the same passages to elucidate concepts in his lexicon. If this is indeed the case with these fragments, then they are indeed closely related in Pacuvius’ tragedy. <p> In my view, the speaker of this fragment is Electra, and her interlocutor Clytaemnestra. Electra is challenging her mother, perhaps on her decision to wed her to Oenax (a theme present in other fragments of this play, frgs. 146-8, 179-80 D’Anna = 88-9, 105 Schierl), or on the question of the death of her father Agamemnon. <p> Alternatively, on the basis of the Electra of Sophocles, may we think of this interchange as a conflict between Electra and the sister Chrysothemis or maybe even the nurse, who as an older figure may counsel Electra on not pursuing the vanities of her youth (fr. 92).', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': '236 (Lindsay)', 'text': 'prolixitudinem.

There seems to be, as far as we can infer, no problem with the context within the play.</p>\n', 'commentary': '<p><b>advenientis</b> Ribbeck, Warmington and Klotz have proposed a lacuna after <i>advenientis</i> to make the line fit into a septenarius trochacius. This has inspired Warmington to propose <i>advenientis Liberi timos pavos</i> instead. Ribbeck instead proposed to delete <i>pavos</i>. This word could also be a gloss, which is another reason to delete it according to Mueller. The line as it is however, could be a senarius iambicus without further emendations. This semi-problem has invited a lot of conjectures. Ribbeck proposed in his apparatus <i>advenientis maximus timos</i> and also <i>advenientis anxiae mentis timos</i>. Bothe, also to ensure a senarius iambicus, emendates to <i>iam ibi advenientis duplicat nos timos, vapos</i>, which seems like a rather large change, which cannot be backed up by anything the manuscripts. Iunius, at last, proposed <i>timos Panos</i> to signify a fear of panic. Ribbeck has even got a lot more conjectures to fill this lacuna which he himself had proposed: <i>intimos animos</i> or <i>intimas mentis</i> or <i>mentis turbatos</i> or <i>animi sollicitos</i>, which all seem like a step too far. A lacuna could indeed exist and <i>pavos</i> could indeed be a gloss, but this is no reason to change the entire line, when the manuscripts seem to agree. \n<p><b>timos pavos</b> Some people (Manutius, Stephanus & Bothe) have emendated <i>pavos</i> to <i>vapos</i>, because they think <i>timos pavos</i> is twice the same thing and that <i>pavos</i> could be a gloss. <i>Vapos</i> would then be a good option, because it is metrically convenient and Nonius uses it as an example, as opposed to <i>pavos</i>. The meaning is less clear. It could be that along with fear, the people are also automatically hot.</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>The fragment is spoken by someone who is telling about an event when he, with others, (<i>nos</i>) came somewhere (<i>ibi</i>) and was immediately overwhelmed by fear (<i>timos, pavos</i>) for someone approaching (<i>advenientis</i>). If we follow Quicherat’s emendation, the people are arriving somewhere and become immediately afraid. This does not change the meaning that much, but leaves out a detail that could probably help us to put this fragment into context. It could be that the someone approaching is Dionysus or some Bacchant of whom people become immediately afraid. Someone from among the people arriving is probably telling a story about what happened to him and others to someone else. A logical conclusion could be that this is a messenger story.<p/>\n<p>From Nonius we know that the fragment is definitely from Naevius’ <i>Lycurgus</i>. The plot of this play is uncertain, but we know something from Hyginus. Furthermore, the play could be based on the tetralogy by Euripides Lycourgia and on the <i>Bacchae</i> by Euripides. From this we learn that the <i>Lycurgus</i> was probably a story about Lycurgus not accepting Dionysus as a god and consequently being punished for this.</p> \n<p>From this, most people assume that this line belongs to a bigger messenger story about people who encounter Bacchi or Bacchae and are immediately struck with fear. This could be a guard who just came back from an encounter with the Bacchi and now tells about this to Lycurgus (Ribbeck, Warmington, Marmorale & Traglia).

The tone is aggressive and the speaker is accusing his addressee using a rhetorical question. The attack is centred on the disorders and turmoils the latter provoked. Considering the tone and the use of a strong verb like <i>concites</i> (which alludes to a certain degree of authority), it appears that the two people involved are powerful and, therefore, it is likely that they are Lycurgus and Liber. </p>\n\n<p>According to Dangel, the fragment contains a part of the speech delivered by Bacchus to Lycurgus. After the king of Thrace had killed the Maenads (see Dang. frg. I), the God threatens him with a deadly punishment (frg. II) – which will become real in Dang. frg. IV – and, in the fragment under analysis (Dang. frg. III), violently accuses him of turmoils and the murder of the Bacchants. The speaker of this fragment is then, according to Dangel, Bacchus and he is speaking to the murderer king.</p>\n\n<p>Warmington agrees with Dangel that Liber is speaking to Lycurgus, but he places this fragment not in the middle of the tragedy, but as first. The scholar moreover argues that Accius probably followed the myth in which the Bacchants are not slaughtered by Lycurgus but set free. These two aspects result in a variation of the meaning: the God is not reproaching the king for the massacre, but warning him as Lycurgus threatens to revolt against Bacchus and his followers.</p>\n\n<p>There is another alternative reconstruction which involves again the king and the God, but where Lycurgus is the speaker and Bacchus the addressee. As Dangel (2009, 338) persuasively argued, the conflict between the two speakers can be presented in terms of contrast between political order (embodied by Lycurgus) and Bacchic fury (Liber). With this in mind, we can read the fragment from another perspective. The Thracian king could accuse Bacchus (and the Bacchants) of creating and spurring disorders in his state, alluding to the Dionysiac forces, emblem of wildness. <i>Turba</i> and <i>belli fluctus</i> are then to be read metaphorically.

Spaltenstein (2008 : 55). The connotations of <i>sollemnitus</i> suggests a religious setting for this scene. If the conjectures of <i>deo</i>, for transmitted <i>adeo</i>, are right, then perhaps a sacrifice for a specific god, in an act of worship, cf. <i>laudet</i>. The enclitic -<i>que</i> suggests this line is not a single line of dialogue, but is part of a longer speech.</p> \n<p><b>†adeo ditali†</b> These words are incomprehensible due to the textual corruption. The transmitted reading cannot stand, because <i>ditali</i> is not a Latin word. Lots of different suggestions have been made for this verse. Warmington’s conjecture <i>deo litat laudem et</i> (“He made good sacrifice of praise to God”, trans. Warmington) - an expression which could be supported by much later usages from post-Republican literature (e.g. Lucan 1,632: <i>diis sanguinem humanum</i>) - would suggest that a god has to be appeased. But Agamemnon is returning from an undertaking, not beginning one. Conjectures which avoid <i>litat</i>, such as Bothe’s <i>attulil laudem et lubens</i> or Mueller’s <i>deo dicat laudes lubens</i> fit better a context of thanksgiving. \n<p><b>lubens</b> Usually means ‘with pleasure’ or ‘willingly’. </p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>Little can be concluded from this corrupted verse. What can be said with certainty is that within a religious setting (cf. <i>sollemnitus</i>) an act of praise (cf. <i>laudet</i> is taking place, or to take place, out of a character’s own volition (cf. <i>lubens</i>. It is not clear whether the character is on stage or offstage. With the transmitted reading, then the verse is concurrent with the action described. That suggests that one speaker is describing an action undertaken by another character, which suggests three alternatives: both characters are on stage, or the action is something offstage which the speaker can see but the audience cannot, or the action is seen by neither the speaker nor the audience, but instead the speaker and the audience can hear it. The only conjecture to alter this is Bothe’s <i>attuli laudem</i>, which changes the line to a retrospective first person description. This would ‘solve’’ the problem of a third person description of present onstage action, a practice avoided by Attic tragedy, although there may be evidence of this practice in later Senecan tragedy (cf. Zanobi (2014) on Seneca’s debts to pantomime).</p>\nThere are several options for speaker and subject. This verse could be about Agamemnon performing sacrifice. Having survived the storm, and victoriously returning to Mycenae after the Trojan War, a sacrifice in thanksgiving to the gods for a safe and successful return would not be unexpected. While Aeschylus’ Agamemnon only refers to his intention to greet the gods (cf. Aesch. <i>Ag</i>. 810-11, 852) and to offer them something in the way of votive offerings (829), he does not offer a sacrifice before he enters the house and meets with death at Clyemnestra’s and Aegisthus’ hands. However, in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>, when he arrives on stage (Sen. <i>Ag.</i> 782, greeting the <i>lares</i>), after a short dialogue with Cassandra, and Agamemnon invokes Jupiter and Juno and his specific plan to sacrifice to them (cf. <i>colam</i>, 807):</p><p><i>At te, pater, qui saeva torques fulmina <br> pellisque nubes, sidera et terras regis, <br> ad quem triumphi spolia victores ferunt, <br> et te sororem cuncta pollentis viri, <br> Argolica Iuno, pecore votivo libens <br> Arabumque donis supplice et fibra colam.</i> Sen. <i>Ag.</i> 802-807</p><p>He leaves the stage and again is killed before he can carry the sacrifice out. So in neither Aeschylus’ Agamemnon or Seneca’s Agamemnon does Agamemnon actually perform a sacrifice onstage, although Seneca’s Agamemnon does at least specifically plan to sacrifice. Interestingly, in Seneca, Agamemnon describes himself as <i>libens</i>, the same word used of the character of <i>frg.</i> 8. In this light, this fragment might be understood as ‘a solemn thanksgiving for a happy home-coming’, see Sanford (1923: 282), which Agamemnon performs before entering his palace. There are multiple possibilities for who could be describing the scene, if it is about Agamemnon performing the sacrifice: it could be the chorus, or it could be Clytemnestra, or any other character, e.g. Cassandra or a messenger. There is an another possibility if the line occurs in the immediate aftermath of Agamemnon’s arrival, that Clytemnestra would be the subject, so that the line is not describing Agamemnon’s worship to a god but instead how Clyemnestra praises Agamemnon (cf. Aesch. <i>Ag.</i> 855-913, esp. 908-913, although here her speech is ironic, saying the opposite of what she means). For this possibility, we must trust Nonius that <i>sollemnitus</i> is not a predicative (i.e. grammatically not masculine singular). \n\n<p>The line might also refer to the assassination of Agamemnon, which can be supported by the reading of <i>sollemnitusque deo litat laudem et lubens</i> by Ribb.<sup>1,2</sup> and Warmington. The verb <i>litat</i> then refers to a sacrifice. Spaltenstein (2008: 49-50) discusses the possibility to read this fragment as a comment on the murder, which is also presented as a sacrifice in Aes. <i>Ag</i>. 1386-1387 τοῦ κατὰ χθονὸς | Διὸς νεκρῶν σωτῆρος εὐκταίαν χάριν and Sen. <i>Ag</i>. 897-898 <i>qualisque ad aras colla taurorum prius | designat oculis antequam ferro</i>. If we follow this idea, the one who commits the murder and does this willingly  (<i>lubens</i>) can be identified with Aegisthus, who would have been happy with the murder, cf. Aes. <i>Ag</i>. 1577 ὦ φέγγος εὖφρον ἡμέρας δικηφόρου. If this fragment does refer to the murder of Agamemnon, the speaker of this verses might perhaps be Cassandra describing the murder, cf. Sen. <i>Ag</i>. 867-909.</p>\n\n<p> If this fragment belongs to the homecoming of Agamemnon, one might presume that the speaker of this line is a messenger, describing Agamemnon’s acts after he comes homes (perhaps, with Seneca’s Agamemnon in mind, even by Eurybates), cf. Spaltenstein (2008: 49). The line might also be sung by the chorus, as suggested by Ribbeck (1875: 29) and Sanford (1923: 282).</p> \n<p>Ribbeck (5/8) and Warmington (4/8) place this fragment in the middle of the play.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': '259 L.', 'text': '<p>sollemnitus pro sollemniter.

D’Anna places the fragment at the beginning of the play in what might be the setting of the wedding between Oeax and Electra or Erigone. The fragment is placed directly after the fragment in which the wedding is explicitly mentioned (frg. 89 Schierl). In his edition, the fragment is the first to allude to a dispute, probably between Electra and Clytaemnestra. Warmington also places the fragment at the beginning of the play but after the prologue in which Orestes receives an oracle and tells how his father lost his fleet during his journey home. The fragment is placed after the fragment in which is stated that you should not give in to anxiety (frg. 99 Schierl), thereby making it the second fragment that is part of the dispute between Clytaemnestra and Electra. Although Ribbeck<sup>3</sup> places the fragment after the same fragment (frg. 99 Schierl), the fragment is assigned a later place. However, the fragment is still placed among other fragments that could refer to a dispute (frg. 92, 89, and 107 Schierl). Hence, he seems to suggest that the dispute took place somewhat later in the play. In Schierl’s arrangement of the fragments, the fragment is also given a later place. In her edition the fragment is placed after the fragment in which Electra or Orestes wishes to become similar to her/his mother in character in order to avenge her/his father (frg. 97 Schierl). She also thinks it likely that the fragment is part of a dispute but keeps the option open that it is not a dispute between Electra and Clytaemnestra about the marriage with Oeax but a dispute between Orestes and somebody who warns him.</p>\n', 'apparatus': '<p>officium] vitium <i>coni. Müller</i></p>\n<p>malefactum] <i>corr. Bamberg, ed. princ.</i> : male fatum <i>codd.</i> : male factum <i>Ribbeck, Warmington</i></p>', 'commentary': '<p><b>nonne</b>] This word is used in ancient Latin for questions to which an affirmative answer is expected. Here the word is used in combination with the deliberative subjunctives <i>fungar</i> and <i>feram</i>. Hence, the question posed by the speaker probably was a rhetorical question.</p>\n<p><b>officium fungar</b>] In ancient Latin <i>fungi</i> was a transitive verb. In combination with a genitive that designates a group or a person, the word combination <i>officium fungi</i> could mean “to behave like”. The speaker then seems to propose that he or she would perform the same task as the people normally do. However, <i>officium fungi</i> could also be translated more literally as “to perform a task”. When translated as such, this raises the question whether the genitive <i>vulgi</i> should be translated as a subjective or objective genitive. When <i>vulgi</i> is considered a subjective genitive and is translated as “the task of the people”, the speaker refers to a task that is normally performed by the people. However, Petaccia (2000, 89) and Manuwald (2003, 77) consider it more likely to translate <i>vulgi</i> as a kind of objective genitive: “the task for the people.” The speaker would then consider the task an obligation to the people. Manuwald (2003, 77) interprets the task as the avenge for Agamemnon and thus concludes that the speaker did consider this avenge not only a family affair but also an obligation to the people. The words might then be spoken by Orestes to somebody who warns him that it could be dangerous to avenge Agamemnon. This could be Pylades for example.</p>\n<p><b>officium</b>] This word could refer to several things. Manuwald (2003, 77) interprets <i>officium</i> as the avenge for Agamemnon. Alternatively, <i>officium</i> could refer to the second part of the sentence: <i>aegre malefactum feram</i>. The speaker is then speaking about the way an evil deed is conceived. Müller (1889) also thinks that the word should refer to the second part of the sentence and therefore proposes the coniecture <i>vitium</i>. Probably because he interprets the arbitrary words <i>aegre malefactum feram</i> as “I should bear this injustice reluctantly” (for the arbitrariness, see the note on <i>aegre malefactum feram</i>). As with <i>nonne</i> an affirmative answer is expected, the speaker would suggest to reconcile himself or herself with the evil deed even if it would be with difficulty. This seems unlikely since the line is probably spoken by Electra or Orestes (see Fragment Reconstruction). Both are usually depicted as rebellious and revengeful. Hence, it seems unthinkable that they would approve of the compliant behaviour of the people and even take it as an example. By emending <i>officium</i> to <i>vitium</i> Müller makes the speakers’ opinion about the behaviour of the people less positive.</p>\n<p><b>aegre malefactum feram</b>] The interpretation of these words is arbitrary. Schierl (2006, 259) translates these words with “die übele Tat ertragen, wenngleich es mir schwerfällt”. According to her, the speaker proposes that he or she would behave like the people and bear the injustice, even when he or she finds this difficult. She identifies the speaker with Electra who discusses her behaviour with Clytaemnestra or Aegisthus. However, this interpretation is problematic as it is not likely that the rebellious and stubborn Electra would propose to comply instead of protest to the <i>malefactum</i>. Müller (1889) recognized this problem and emended <i>officium</i> to <i>vitium</i>. However, his emendation solves the problem only partly. Although the speaker conceives the behavour of the people more negatively, as long as <i>nonne</i> is retained an affirmative answer is expected. Thus he or she still proposes to comply and bear the evil dead. This problem does not arise with the interpretation of Warmington (1936, 210) and Manuwald (2003, 77), who consider <i>aegre ferre</i> a fixed combination for “to take it ill” or “to resent”. With this reading, the words indicate that the speaker does <i>not</i> want to reconcile himself or herself with the evil deed. Müllers emendation is then no longer necessary, since the speaker could suggest that the injustice should not be accepted by the people either. Whether they have complied with it or not, it would have been their task not to accept it.</p>\n<p><b>malefactum</b>] The manuscripts read <i>male fatum</i>. However, in combination with the other adverb <i>aegre</i>, <i>male</i> would not make sense. Therefore, Bamberg changed these words to <i>malefactum</i>. His correction is accepted by all later editors but Warmington and Ribbeck print an interspace between <i>male</i> and <i>factum</i>. <i>malefactum</i> with or without interspace might refer to the murder of Agamemnon. However, it could also refer or to something else that is devised by Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus, for example the marriage between Oeax and Erigone or Electra.</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>Nonius in his <i>De compendiosa doctrina</i> (Non. 797 Li. =  497,4 Merc.) ascribes the fragment to the Dulorestes of Pacuvius. None of the editors has doubted this attribution.</p>\n\n<p>The fragment is written in the <i>septenarius trochaicus</i>, which makes it plausable that the line was part of a dialoge. The fact that the speaker uses the first person singular verbs <i>fungar</i> and <i>feram</i> to refer to himself or herself makes is also less likely that the line would have been spoken by the chorus. All editors interpret the line as part of a dispute. Warmington (1936, 211) and Schierl (2006, 259) suggest that the words could have been spoken by Electra to Clytaemnestra or Aegisthus. With this line she could have defended her right to be critical or condemnatory and to disapprove with the <i>malefactum</i>. This dispute could be about the murder of Agamemnon which Electra considers an evil deed. In that case, the fragment was probably part of the beginning of the play in which Electra could have expressed the wish that the murder would be avenged. Schierl (2006, 259) also suggests that Electra could have spoken these words to Orestes when they discuss how she should behave. Electra might have wanted to play a bigger part in the avenge of her father than Orestes had planned. The fragment would then have been part of a later scene, as Orestes first has to arrive in Mycene disguished as a slave.</p> \n\n<p>Another possibility is that Electra refers with <i>malefactum</i> to the fact that Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus had given her or her half-sister Erigone to Oeax in marriage. Her marriage with Oeax would certainly be involuntary as Oeax was one of the enemies of Agamemnon. Even if not she herself but her half-sister would be betrothed to him, she would probably disapprove. If a wedding was part of the plot, it was probably one of the first scenes of the play since it requires Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus to be alive and because it provides an additional motive for their murder. The dispute about this wedding could have been part of the scene but could also have been staged just before or after this scene.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the words could have been spoken by Orestes. Petaccia (2000, 89) and Manuwald (2003, 77) that the words could have been spoken by Orestes. This interpretation is based on the fact that <i>vulgi</i> could not only be read as a subjective genitive about (the task <i>of</i> the people) but also as an objective genitive (the task <i>for</i> the people). In the latter case, the speaker speaks about an obligation he or she has to the people. A likely interpretation would than be that Orestes is speaking about his obligation to avenge his father. The addressee would probably be somebody who warned him for the potential dangers of murdering Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus. A likely candidate would be his comrade Pylades. In this case, the fragment could be part of an opening scene in which Pylades and Orestes undertake their journey to Mycene and scheme the murder of Clytaemnestra and Aegisthus. However, an interpretation of <i>vulgi</i> as objective genitive does not exclude the possibility that the words are spoken by Electra. <i>officium</i> could also refer to the second part of the sentence (<i>aegre malefactum feram</i>). The speaker is than arguing that he or she has the obligation to function as spokesman or spokeswoman for the people. This could be both Orestes and Electra.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it also possible that the fragment is not part of a dialogue but of a monologue. Since questions stat start with <i>nonne</i> are often rhetorical, the words are not necessarily directed to other people on stage. The speaker, Electra or Orestes, might have ask the question to herself/ himself while considering what to do or how to behave in reaction to the murder of Agamemnon or the betrothal to Oeax.</p>\n\n<pre>                                                                     \n<p>                           <b><i>officium fungi</i></b>\n                          /              \\\n                         /                \\\n          <b>“to behave like”</b>           <b>“to perform a task”</b>\n      = same task as the people         /             \\\n             normally have             /               \\\n                  \\            <b>“of the people”       “for the people”</b>\n                   \\        = subjective genitive    = objective genitive\n                    \\               /                       |                      \n                     \\             /                        |                       \n      <i>officium</i> refers to the second part              <i>officium</i> refers\n                   of the sentence                    to the murder of\n                 /                \\                   Clytaemnestra\n                /                  \\                  and Aegisthus\n<b>Electra defending      Electra defending the</b>                |\n<b>the right to be        right to be</b>                          |\n<b>critical on            critical on                Orestes in respons to</b>\n<b>the murder of\t       the marriage with          a warning of Pylades</b>\n<b>Agamemnon              Oeax</p>\t\t         \n</pre>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina', 'text': '<p> Nonius quotes this line in his <i>De compendiosa doctrina</i> to show that the verb <i>fungi</i> could have an object in the accusative case instead of the ablative case.</p> <p>accusativus positus pro ablativo.

The second speaker seems to be on good account with the first one, because he warns him for the danger.</p>\n<p>There are several possibilities for the first speaker, namely Aegisthus or Klytaimnestra. We can assume this from the fact that the other speaker says that he or she is in mortal danger. According to Schierl (2012, 264-265), the answer is given by Oiax. However, Hunink (2007, 176) and D’Anna (1968, 206) assume that this dialogue is between Aegisthus and Orestes (cf. Schierl 2012, 265). This statement is then an example of dramatic irony and may be a comic element in this tragedy. This seems not probable to me, because they speak about a third person. It is more logical that this third person must be Orestes. Warmington (1936, 216-217) does only say that Aegisthus is the speaker of the first part and that the second part is spoken by an unspecified friend of Aegisthus.</p>\n<p>Besides, scholars do not agree of the warning is given when Orestes is already there (Warmington 1936, 217; Mette 1964, 97) or not (Ribbeck 1997, 242; Müller 1889, 26; Argenio 1959, 32).

Considering this situation “– it seems pretty clear that the situation is settled somewhere around the death of Agamemnon – be it shortly after Agamemnon has turned home together with his concubine Cassandra, or: after his death and before the murder will be revenged by Electra and/or Orestes.” (Wessels 2019).</p>\n<p>Scholars such as Warmington, Spaltenstein and Aricó suggest that Aegisthus is referring to Electra, based on the parallel of Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i> (951; 997-1000), where Electra has taken refuge at the altar and Aegisthus orders the slaves (<i>famuli</i>, 997) to carry her away in exile and imprison her. On the other hand, Bothe proposes that these words, referring to Electra, are spoken by Clytaemnestra. It is not that such words per se would not suit the queen because of the more traditional female role that she assumes in both Aeschylus and Seneca, as Spaltenstein (2008, 66) argues. In fact, in Aeschylus she is the active shaper of the play and she is even compared with a man (Aesch. <i>Ag</i>. 1029). Instead, it is the emphasis on the speaker’s authority that renders Aegisthus a more suitable choice. He is the new king who needs, even more as a usurper, to establish his authority, a pattern familiar also from Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>, where he also appears as a vindictive tyrant (1434sqq; 1638sqq). The resistance that his addressees had apparently shown might well be explained by this fact, as well as by his order to perform an impious act: the removal of a suppliant from the altar. </p>\n<p>Both Electra and Cassandra had found refuge at the altar in Seneca (and Cassandra alone in Aeschylus). Both are to be drawn away, the first to be imprisoned, the second to meet Agamemnon’s fate. Both are willing to leave the altar and die. As Sanford (1923, 284) points out “[…] we get no real help in interpreting Livius’ lines”.  Whether <i>hanc</i> refers to Cassandra or Electra is quite unclear, but one indication that we could use in favor of the latter could be the mention of the <i>natae</i>, the daughters in Livius’ fragment 4, which if preceding, could explain Electra’s presence on stage (Spaltenstein 2008, 65).</p> \n<p><sub>Bibliography</sub></p>\nAricó, G. 1979.

The second reading <i>nereis</i> probably arises from diplography with the ‘s’ beginning the following <i>simum</i>.</p>\n', 'commentary': '<p><b>Nerei … pecus]</b> ‘a playful snub-nosed cattle of Nereus’. It seems clear that <i>pecus</i> must refer to animals. Presumably, the animals do not have four legs, since Nonius uses this verse in order to explain that <i>pecus</i> may also refer to animals with any number of feet (or none at all). Because of the association with Nereus, the speaker presumably means sea animals. Therefore, a cattle of animals from the sea with more or less than four legs, encircles a fleet (<i>classem</i>): one might assume that the speaker has been part of the fleet (<i>classem</i>). Animals that are often associated with Nereus are dolphins, cf. <i>Anthologia Lyrica Graeca</i> (Diehl) p. 5-6 φιλόμουσοι | δελφῖνες, ἔναλα θρέμματα | κουρᾶν Νηρεΐδων θεᾶν. A verbal echo of this line can be found back in Pac. <i>frg</i>. 238 (Schierl) <i>Nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus</i>, which refers to a group of dolphins (Schierl 2006: 492).</p>\n<p><b>simum]</b> Pliny describes the nose of the dolphin as <i>simus</i>,‘snubnosed’, (a feature that, according to Pliny, gives rise to a popular name for the dolphin, cf. Plin. <i>Nat</i>. 9.7.23 <i>pro voce gemitus humano similis, dorsum repandum, rostrum simum: qua de causa nomen simonis omnes miro modo agnoscunt maluntque ita appellari</i>.)</p> \n<p><b>ludens ad cantum]</b> It cannot be surely said who are actually singing. <i>cantum</i> must refer to people on the ship. It is unlikely to be the captive women, because the dolphins are put in a playful mood by the song (<i>ludens ad cantum</i>), which suggests that the song is cheerful. Therefore, it seems most plausible to argue that the Greek sailors on the ships are the ones that are singing (cf. Spaltenstein 2008: 40, ‘<i>Ad cantum</i> paraît certes, à première vue, impliquer le plaisier des marins’). In the Greco-Roman literary tradition dolphins are known as animals sensitive to music, who are influenced by song, for instance, in the story of the poet Arion who is saved by a dolphin (Hdt. 1.23-25). cf. Ael. <i>Anim</i>. 11. 12 Οἱ δελφῖνες, τὸ μὲν φιλόμουσον αὐτῶν καὶ περὶ τὴν ᾠδὴν σπουδαῖόν τε καὶ φιλόπονον κεκηρυκταί τε καὶ ἐς πολλοὺς ἐξεφοίτησε and Plin. <i>Nat</i>. 9.8.24 <i>Delphinus non homini tantum amicum animal verum et musicae arti</i>. They are also sacred to Apollo, the god of poetry (Apollo himself once changed himself into a dolphin, cf. <i>Hymn to Apollo</i> 399-400: αὐτὰρ ὃ τοῖσι συνήντετο Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων· | ἐν πόντῳ δ᾽ ἐπόρουσε δέμας δελφῖνι ἐοικὼς | νηὶ θοῇ καὶ κεῖτο πέλωρ μέγα τε δεινόν τε).</p> \n<p><b>classem]</b> The word <i>classis</i> implies multiple ships. The group of dolphins in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i> also swim past the fleet, cf. Sen. <i>Ag</i>. 453 <i>anteire naves laetus et rursus sequi</i>.</p>\n<p><b>lustratur]</b> According to Nonius 528 L. <i>lustrari</i> and <i>circumire</i> are synonyms. The same word is used at Sen. <i>Ag</i>. 455 to describe a group of dolphins encircling a ship: <i>millesimam nunc ambit et lustrat ratem</i>.</p> \n<p><b>< v x></b> The last foot is missing from Nonius’ citation. Different suggestions have been made to supplement the end of line 2 (see <i>apparatus criticus</i>). Whereas other conjectures, such as Quicherat’s <i>citam</i> (which seems at odds with the relaxed mood of the soldiers) or Traglia’s <i>virum</i> (which would, somewhat unnecessarily, specify who was singing), would shift the focus away from the dolphins, Ribbeck (1875: 29) plausibly conjectures <i>choro</i>. The description of the dolphins as a <i>chorus</i> would correspond to the musicality of the dolphins and their playful character (<i>ludens</i>). Additionally, a group of animals may also be generally referred to as a <i>chorus</i>. There are also textual parallels that argue in favour of the reading <i>choro</i> from both earlier and later Greek and Latin literature, cf. Eur. <i>Hel</i>. 1454-1455 καλλιχόρων | δελφίνων and Verg. <i>Aen</i>. 7.391 <i>te lustrare choro</i>. It would also add to the alliteration of <i>cantum classem</i>. Finally, one could find it tempting to supplement <i>choro</i> in order to produce an argument for an echo of Livius Andronicus in the scene with the dolphins in Seneca, where Seneca also describes the group of dolphins as a <i>chorus</i>, cf. Sen. <i>Ag</i>. 454 <i>nunc prima tangens rostra lascivit chorus</i>. Other conjectures based on Seneca echoing Livius’ description is Lenchantin de Gubernatis’ <i>freto</i> or <i>salo</i>, but similar to Quicherat’s conjecture, these are quite colourless and add nothing to the scene.</p>\n<p>Spaltenstein (2008: 39) argues that the sentence is complete and that the last two syllables could belong to a new sentence. This might find support from Welsh’s finding (2012: 830-834) that Nonius sometimes quotes partial verses ‘when they form part of a quotation that is longer than one verse’ (831) when the quotation forms a complete sentence.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>The speaker of this line draws the attention to <i>lascivum Nerei simum pecus</i>, which must be a group of dolphins that is encircling a fleet. The picture of dolphins encircling a fleet seems to imply serenity on sea. The lines are certainly spoken by one of the characters, possibly a messenger (cf. Spaltenstein 2008: 40). The meter, the <i>iambic senarius</i>, suggests that the chorus can be excluded as speaker. The character may be describing a situation they personally experienced, or news they have heard of the fleet. Hypothetically any of the characters who have been informed about the fleet’s return could speak these lines, but if the speech is reflective of other plays featuring the Greek fleet’s return, and especially if Livius’ play is the model of Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>, it is likely to be delivered by a messenger, perhaps the herald Eurybates as in Seneca’s play.</p>\n<p>In Sen. <i>Ag.</i> 449-455 we read:</p> <p><i>tunc qui iacente reciprocus ludit salo | tumidumque pando transilit dorso mare <br> Tyrrhenus omni piscis exultat freto <br> agitatque gyros et comes lateri adnatat, <br> anteire naves laetus et rursus sequi; <br> nunc prima tangens rostra lascivit chorus, <br> millesimam nunc ambit et lustrat ratem. </i></p> <p>Seneca seems to echo Livius Andronicus’ fragment in several ways: it echoes single words, such as <i>lustratur</i> (frg. 6, l. 1) / <i>lustrat</i> (Sen. <i>Ag.</i> 455), <i>ludens</i> (frg. 6, l. 2) / <i>ludit</i> (Sen. <i>Ag.</i>. 449) and <i>lascivum</i> (frg. 6, l. 1) / <i>lascivit</i> (Sen. <i>Ag.</i> 454), as well as structural motifs including the playful character of the dolphins, the encircling movements around the ship (Sen. <i>Ag.</i>. 452 <i>agitatque gyros</i>; 455 <i>ambit et lustrat ratem</i>) and the happy mood of the sailors (428 <i>laetum remigem</i>). The question is how probable it is that Seneca has drawn inspiration from Livius Andronicus. Ribbeck (1875: 29) argues that Seneca ‘in dieser Partie den Text des alten Dichters [sc. Liv. Andr.] vor Augen gehabt hat’, but one could also surmise that Seneca is not specifically referencing Livius Andronicus and rather engaging with (e.g epic or dramatic) intertexts, that are now lost: the accompanying of the dolphins was a common <i>topos</i> within the homecoming story of the Greeks.</p>\n<p>There seems to be consensus on the placement of this fragment in the <i>Aegisthus</i>. Ribbeck and Warmington place the fragment prior to most of the other fragments (quoting it as the second fragment of the total eight fragments surviving). If Seneca’s play is modeled after Livius’, and Livius’ lines are spoken by a messenger as in Seneca’s play, it is likely they are spoken prior to Agamemnon’s arrival (cf.

If this fragment also was about misfortune, as <i>malum</i> might suggest, the speaker is just talking about a terrible misfortune which has very recently occurred to him.  <p><b>contigerit</b>: The subjunctive form might mean that we have a portion of indirect speech.  <p><b>quam maxime</b>] This emphatic expression grammatically qualifies contigerit, but it is ambiguous whether it is emphasising the time and location (<i>hic hodie contigerit</i>), in which case it would imply that the speaker expected some evil, but not so soon and in this location, or whether it is emphasising the magnitude of the evil (<i>contigerit malum</i>).  <p>hic hodie] This has a very strong deictic effect: <i>hic</i> is spatial and limits the event under discussion to the immediate vicinity, while <i>hodie</i> limits the timeframe of the event to the same day.</p>  <p> The different conjectures given are to restore different metrical arrangements to the line. There is no actual issue with the text that the manuscripts transmit, but in order to fit more common metres scholars have altered word order and made insertions. The arrangement offered here is a lyric, but with the first person singular voice, the words might fit a monody better than a chorus. It is also worth noting that as regards the content, a monody sung by Thyestes might be a better fit than ascribing the words to the chorus</p>.', 'reconstruction': '<p>Scholars have proposed two different contexts based on what they believe the setting of the play must have been: Ribbeck (1875, 203) interprets the fragment (as with Frg. 135) as a line spoken by Thyestes after finding out that Atreus killed his children and served them to him. Ribbeck’s ascription of the verse is based on his interpretation that Ennius’ version of the play only concerns the Thyestean feast (Ribbeck 1875, 199). On the other hand, Jocelyn suggested that the line refers to the rape of Pelopia, that Thyestes indicates that an evil committed by accident (his incest) will have a positive outcome in the fulfilment of Apollo’s oracle and the downfall of Atreus (413-4). Apart from considerations of whether the plot only covered the Thyestean feast, or also events at Sicyon, then the interpretation also comes down to whether there is an oxymoronic tone or not. One difficulty with Jocelyn’s account is that there seem to be different variations of the Sicyon component of the story - in one tradition, which seems to be traceable in Hyginus 87, Thyestes had received Apollo’s oracle, that a son born to him from Pelopia would carry out the revenge on Atreus, before his incestuous rape of Pelopia, and that was a conscious act (<i>quod cum audisset filiam compressit</i>, Hyg. <i>Fab.</i> 87), whereas in Hyginus 88, Thyestes rapes Pelopia not knowing who she is and without hearing an oracle from Apollo - later in this version, he travels to Delphi but there is no mention of whether he received an oracle even then, or the content of that oracle, before being seized by Agamemnon and Menelaus. There is also no need to think there is an oxymoronic quality to combining <i>Fortuna</i> or <i>contigerit</i> a positive quality that is contrasted with <i>malum</i>: <i>Fortuna</i> was frequently an ambiguous figure, if we consider evidence from Plautus or the contemporary inscriptions addressed to <i>Mala Fortuna</i>. See further the discussions in the commentary at the lemma <i>Fortuna</i> for frg. 135.</p>  <p>In Hyginus 88, there is also much more mention of chance and fortune, which might suggest origins in a tragic plot that might relate to Ennius’ play: Pelopia happens to perform her sacrifices into the grove where Thyestes is hiding (<i>ibi casu nocte</i>, 88.3) which leads to them meeting; Agamemnon and Menelaus happen to be consulting Delphi at the same time as Thyestes is, which leads to them capturing him (<i>casu Thyestes eo venerat</i>, 88.8). These elements of chance may suggest that it has its seeds in a tragic plot. There is also the suggestion of a recognition scene in the encounter between Thyestes and Aegisthus. Finally, the words <hic hodie> suggest the tragic device of the events of the play’s plot transpiring in one day.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina', 'text': "<p>Non. <i>De compendiosa doctrina</i> (410 Lindsay): <i>contingere, evenire … Ennius Thyeste: quam mihi ... contigerit malum</i> (Lindsay 1903, 410).

Spaltenstein (2008, 64-65) uses two very compelling arguments to support that Agamemnon is the implicit subject of <i>fligit</i>. Firstly, the Homeric echo of the verse due to the violence of the terms <i>fligit</i> and <i>saucius</i>, that aptly relates to a character such Agamemnon. Secondly, the paradox of <i>ipsus se</i> which seems to imply that Agamemnon is entangled in the lethal cloth given to him by Clytaemnestra, as in Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i> (1382 sqq) and Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i> (887sqq). On the contrary, Terzaghi and Aricó suggest that the dying character is Aegisthus. If, however, we take into account the arguments above along with the fact that both, in Aeschylus’ <i>Choephoroi</i> and in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>, the murder of Aegisthus is mentioned only marginally, this suggestion seems rather improbable.</p>\n<p>A question remains: who is the speaker of these words? Considering that they most likely refer to Agamemnon’s death, it would seem logical to suppose either Cassandra or Clytaemnestra (Spaltenstein 2008, 64). Indeed, in Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i> it is the queen who describes the killing and the fall of Agamemnon (1380 sqq). By co-examining, though, this verse with fragment 4, where it is most probable that we encounter the murder setting of Agamemnon, it would seem only natural that this fragment serves as the continuation of his demise. In that case, it would be logical to imagine the same speaker describing the death, and the most suitable candidate would be Cassandra (as also in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i> 901sqq).</p>\n<p><sub>Bibliography</sub></p>\nAricó, G. 1979.

One possibility is that this line comes from a narration of off-stage events, and the character described is not on stage. However, another possibility is that the character and the speaker are both on stage physically, but the stage space is itself divided. This could occur like a Plautine aside, so that the speaker addresses an audience - either the real audience or an on-stage internal audience - while the character is onstage, but the character does not overhear the speaker.</p> <p><b>parat] </b>Many scholars have thought there is a problem with <i>parat</i> since it violates the Bentley-Luchs rule. This is in fact two complementary laws about the length of unstressed syllable segments in different parts of the line. Luchs’ Law states that if the first half of the fifth metron cannot be short, but must either be a long or resolved into two shorts.</p> <p>The manuscripts are all unanimous in reading <i>parat</i>. And even then, we should be cautious about applying a metrical law developed to handle Plautus’ metrical practices to Ennius’ fragments. Yet if for the sake of argument we adopt the hypothesis that Luchs’ Law applies to Ennius too, then there have been some conjectures offered in place of <i>parat</i> to consider. Bothe made the conjecture of the iterative <i>paritat</i>, which does occur twice in Plautus, but it is an incredibly rare word. Others have suggested <i>curat</i> which is palaeographically not too distant from <i>parat</i> given that the scribe could easily have jumbled the letters with <i>putat</i> that follows when reading the line, <i>ur</i> and <i>ar</i> appearing quite similar in many miniscule scripts. Both conjectures solve the problem of the violation of Luch’s law, and <i>curat</i> might be preferred because it is at least a common term that fits well with the sense required, of mental activity, whereas <i>parito</i>, which besides being very rare, is less appropriate to thought, but would rather describe the preparation of action. However, this is not a very strong argument.</p> <p>In fact, if we keep sight of the text, it’s worth exploring the idea that the effect that Luchs’ law is apparently used to avoid might have been intentionally exploited by Ennius for poetological ends. It is hypothesised that the reason for Luchs’ Law is to avoid an iamb in the fifth metron (instead of a spondee or an anapaest) and the resulting impression that the senarius has ended, in a similar way to the fifth metron of the hexameter being a dactyl, rather than a spondee. However, it might be possible that Ennius deliberately wanted to give the initial impression that the line did end with <i>parat</i>, before then revealing to his audience that the character was still involved in mental considerations. To consider this hypothesis, we should consider how Ennius intertwines sense and metre in the first four metrons of the line. In the first and second metrons the focus is on the course of action, <i>ibi quid agat, se-</i>, and two resolutions are found here, moving the line quickly along. In the third and fourth metrons, <i>-cum cogitat</i>, the line slows down with a preponderance of long syllables, suggesting the slowness of the mental deliberation. The course of action envisaged is decisive and rapid, but the mental deliberations around it are careful and weighty. We could apply this link between sense and metre to the fifth and sixth metrons, to explain the apparent violation of Luchs’ law. <i>parat</i> in the fifth metron might suggest to the audience the beginning of action and would make for an appropriate place to end the line, if we think about sense, not metre. Yet their expectations are confounded by <i>putat</i> in the sixth metron where the character is shown to still be mentally deliberating. There might then be an interesting interaction between metre and sense in this line, and potentially humour derived from the deviation from normal metrical practise in the fifth metron, on this hypothesis. Given Ennius’ predilection for playful experimentation with hexameter, could he not have approached the senarius with a similar attitude? (cf. also frg. 138)</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>The context of the fragment is obscure. Considering the argumentation about the plot of Thyestes the interpretations of the fragment vary. Therefore, the speaker is unknown and the verse might refer either to Atreus either to Thyestes. Ribbeck excludes the possibility that it might refer to someone else, since, according to him, there is no trace of the presence of Aerope (Atreus’ wife) in the tragedy of Ennius. Some scholars speculate that the verse alludes to Atreus, who, perhaps, was aware that his brother returned and initiated to plan his revenge against him. On the other hand, Bothe claims with certainty that the verse refers to Thyestes, who returns and estimates how to take revenge from Atreus after the cannibalistic feast. Finally, Boyle suggests that since the context is uncertain, the verse can be attributed to either Atreus or Thyestes.</p> <p>The fragment reminds us of the passage of Plautus’ <i>Miles Gloriosus</i> in which the character Periplectomenos is describing how the slave Palaestrio, the <i>servus callidus</i> and self-titled “architect” of the play (cf. <i>Mil.</i> 901), is developing his plans. The Plautan passage translates into words the bodily display of the thought processes going on in Palaestrio’s mind, for instance Palaestrio slapping his thigh represents the “light-bulb moment” of his idea.<p> Additionally, Warmington (1935) suggests doubtfully that the fragment might derive from the prologue of the tragedy when Atreus prepares his evils plans of feeding his brother the limbs of his murdered children.

The Latin transliterations suggested by the editors can be summarised in the form “<i>Cly/u/it(a)em(n)stra</i>”. As Spaltenstein (2008, 62) states, the absence of –<i>mn</i>– in the vast majority of the corrections should not surprise us because of the form <i>Κλυταιμήστρα</i> that we also find in the corpus of the Greek tragedies. The correct form of Clytaemnestra’s name has concerned both ancient and modern critics, with the two most prominent etymologies being <i>Clytemestra</i> (from κλυτός + μήδομαι, “renowned for her cunning”) and <i>Clytemnestra</i> (from κλυτός + μνηστεύω, “renowned for her suitor/wooing”). In her dissertation on the figure of Clytaemnestra (2020), Simas draws upon passages from the <i>Odyssey</i> to examine etymological evidence for each one of the two forms and reaches a very insightful conclusion. Both forms are equally crucial for her role in the poem by creating connections with Penelope, either to highlight her own ambiguous μῆτις, or to contrast her fidelity (64-65).</p>\n<p>Pius punctuates with a colon after <i>Clytaemestra</i>. Such a choice would render her the subject of <i>conlocat</i>. The following <i>tertias</i>, however, illustrates three parties, therefore the commas following <i>regias</i> and <i>iuxtim</i> seem crucial for the distinction between them.</p>\n<p><b>iuxtim:</b> ‘next to’. According to Nonius (185 L.) it is used instead of the later form, <i>iuxta</i>. While on first glance it might seem archaistic, “it must have been nothing notable to Livius, […] as the first adverbs in –<i>tim</i> were accusatives crystallised in this function” (Spaltenstein 2008, 62)[own translation from French].</p>\n<p><b>natae:</b> this word most likely indicates the two other daughters of Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra, Electra and Chrysothemis. Chrysothemis does not appear in Aeschylus’s <i>Agamemnon</i> (as also the rest of the children) nor in <i>Choephoroi</i> or in Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>. Nevertheless, her presence is attested in Homer (<i>Il</i>. 9.145;287), in Euripides’ <i>Phoenician Women</i> and in Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>, where she has a more active role on her sister’s side. If we adopt the edition’s punctuation we can imagine the royal chair attributed to the missing subject of <i>conlocat</i>, the second one attributed to Clytaemnestra and the third, <i>tertias</i>, being shared by the two sisters.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>Considering the phrase <i>sedes regias</i> as well as the edition’s punctuation placing Clytaemnestra on the second chair, it is logical to assume that the missing subject of <i>conlocat</i> is the king, either Agamemnon or Aegisthus.</p>\n<p>Terzaghi (1925, 32) suggests that these verses describe Aegisthus’ ascension to the throne in the form of an official ceremony, which we can imagine at a moment after Aegisthus and Clytaemnestra receive the urn with the (alleged) ashes of Orestes, the final threat against their reign. However, the presence of Electra and Chrysothemis on the third seats seems rather unnatural, even if we take into account their residing in the palace according to Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i>; and especially if we consider Electra’s strong hatred and objection towards the new king and queen. Moreover, Terzaghi connects these verses with frg. 5, <i>iamne oculos specie laetavisti optabili</i>, in which Aegisthus asks Clytaemnestra if she is content with the sight of Orestes’ ashes. Such a ceremonial ascension scene appears nowhere in the former literary tradition and even if we examine more closely Sophocles’ <i>Electra</i> instead of Aeschylus, when Clytaemnestra receives the urn, Aegisthus is absent from the palace and returns only after her death. Overall, Terzaghi’s interpretation is strongly based on the assumption that Aegisthus plays a protagonistic role, a suggestion that we should examine with great caution.</p>\n<p>A far more plausible and generally accepted interpretation (Warmington. Spaltenstein, Aricó) attributes these words to Cassandra, who is describing the murder of Agamemnon. Apart from the fact that it is much more logical to imagine Agamemnon taking a seat next to Clytaemnestra and his daughters during the welcoming banquet before his murder, Warmington and Spaltenstein identify a strong parallel with the murder scene of Seneca’s <i>Agamemnon</i>, where Cassandra is describing his demise in a state of prophetic trance (872 sqq). The dissimilar murder scene in Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i> further supports this parallelism, as Agamemnon is murdered in the bathtub. Even if the comparison with a subsequent parallel seems inadequate for the conclusion above, Agamemnon’s murder during a banquet is also familiar from Homer (<i>Od</i>. 4.529-536), where Aegisthus invites him upon his arrival for dinner in the palace and kills him. That way Livius’ introduction of the two daughters in the “murder banquet” would be much more functional by adding to the dramatic effect of the scene. Warmington expresses doubts regarding Cassandra’s trance state. By employing a more rational approach, he suggests that she is describing from a distance what she sees happening inside the palace. Such a proposal would not be improbable and is certainly scenically possible (cf. Sen. <i>HF</i>. 1022 sqq.; Plaut. <i>Bacch</i>. 832sqq.), but the figure of Cassandra herself seems to naturally presuppose a state of divine delirium (Spaltenstein 2008, 58).</p><p><sub>Bibliography</sub></p>\nAricó, G. 1979.

Minucius Thermus, accusing him of inventing battles in his Ligurian campaign in order to win a triumph. See further in the reconstruction.<p> <p>Metre: As a <i>fragmentum incertum</i>, no editors have included this fragment with the fragments of Ennius, given that the Ciceronian quotations give no indication of which Ennian play it might belong to. For that matter, the scansion of the line is unclear. If taken as a single line, the words as transmitted in the order Cicero gives them are unmetrical, although various transpositions have been suggested, most focussed on moving <i>regni</i> to avoid elision with <i>est</i> which is the blemish on an the otherwise recognisably (offset) line of an iambic senarius. On the other hand, Bothe suggested a line break after <i>societas</i>, rendering the words the end and beginning of two trochaic septenarii. This would give a double resolution in the final metron, which would be a little unusual, when the four shorts are more easily accommodated within the middle of the line of an iambic senarius. Some kind of iambo-trochaic line is likely, but it could well be that Cicero has jumbled or adapted the word order, or added <i>est</i>.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>Only a few commentators are confident enough to even suggest this fragment belongs to Ennius’ Thyestes, much less to hazard a guess as to the line’s speaker or its context in the play. Such a attribution was cautiously offered by Bothe and followed with similar caution by Ribbeck in all three versions of his edition, though in his 1875 monograph Ribbeck displays considerably more confidence. La Penna thought it refers to the relationship between Atreus and Thyestes (La Penna (1977) 15). As a generalised comment on a political situation, almost any character or the chorus could be imagined voicing the line. With respect to the metrical structure, which allows for both a iambic (Vossius) or trochaeic (Heusinger, Bothe, Ribbeck2) metre (see commentary), it seems to be more probable that the line was spoken by one of the dramatis personae.<p> <p>The line itself seems echoed in Seneca’s Thyestes. The satelles, Atreus’ servant, opines <i>ubi non est pudor / nec cura iuris sanctitas pietas fides, / instabile regnum est</i> (Sen. Thy. 215-7, ‘where there is no shame or care for law, or reverence or piety or trust, / the throne totters’). But then this parallel has prompted the attribution of frg. 150 in the first place (similarly with frg. 163 inc. and the parallel with Accius’ Atreus), so arguments will inevitably involve an element of circularity. The key question is whether there is a tradition in plays based on the Thyestes myth of critiquing the endurance of values such as <i>societas</i> and <i>fides</i> under a tyrannical figure such as Atreus, or whether we are taking quotations such as frgg. 150 and 163 which could also belong to other plays and contexts in Ennius and in fact constructing such a tradition ourselves. La Penna highlights observations by Skutsch and Timpanaro of anti-tyrannical sentiments within the <i>Annals</i>, but the line in question (<i>Ann.</i> frg. 150 Sk, <i>et qui se sperat Romae regnare Quadratae?</i>, probably concerning one of the would-be tyrants, Sp. Cassius, Sp. Maelius, or M. Manlius Capitolinus, of the early Republic, merely shows that an observation on <i>regnum</i> would not be out of place in a play by Ennius (cf. Timpanaro (1950), Skutch (1967), Skutch (1985) 306-307).</p> <p>Ennius may possibly be alluding to Cato’s speech <i>De falsis pugnibus</i>. In a fragment of that speech, preserved by Aulus Gellius, Cato attacks Minucius for having the decemvirs whipped, an act that Cato says “no king has dared to do” and which is contrary to the <i>fides maiorum</i>: <br><i>quis hanc contumeliam, quis hoc imperium, quis hanc servitutem ferre potest? nemo hoc rex ausus est facere: eane fieri bonis, bono genere gnatis, boni consultis? ubi societas? ubi fides maiorum?</i>. Here we have another instance from early Republican literature where the absence of <i>societas</i> and <i>fides</i> is connected with tyranny and cruelty, which certainly strengthen the attribution of the <i>incertum</i> to <i>Thyestes</i>. Moreover, perhaps the Ennian line might be an allusion specifically to Cato’s speech: according to Nepos (<i>Cato</i> 1.4), Cato was the one to bring Ennius to Rome from Sardinia in 204BC, and according to Cicero (<i>Sen., Cato regarded him as a familiaris. The very late source Aurelius Victor (4th cent) even states that it was Ennius who taught Cato Greek (<i>Vir. Illu.</i> 47.1), but this is likely an invention (see Gruen (1990) 107-9). And <i>de falsis pugnis<i> was a well-known speech in the contemporary period: Plautus in <i>Truculentus<i> alludes to it. The speech was delivered in 190BC, which is not too distant from the performance date of <i>Thyestes</i> in 169BC. Even if not a specific allusion, the connection between <i>societas</i> and <i>fides</i> and good governance was alive in the contemporary discourse.</p> <p>The line could be a general statement criticising monarchy and either offered by the chorus (since the metre is unclear) or by one of the characters. For instance, it could be made by one of Thyestes’ children or Thyestes himself, while approaching Atreus’ palace (if the plot followed a similar pattern to Seneca’s Thyestes). But the line could be a specific critique or warning to Atreus - in which case it would be more analogous to the <i>satelles’</i> first warning in Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i>, quoted above.</p>', 'status': 'Incertum', 'context': [], 'lines': [{'line_number': '150', 'text': 'nulla sancta societas nec fides regni est'}], 'linked_fragments': ['925aa0d3623c4bc2a9f05ac66295270e'], 'lock': 0, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>

The main problem is that these readings do not fit with the metre, which is trochaic septenar as Ribbeck, Lindsay, Marmorale, Klotz and Traglia suggest. To solve this problem, Bothe emends <iniuros> which is accepted by all modern editors mainly because it is compatible with the metre. With an extra syllable added to the transmitted <i>iniuros</i>, the problem of the metre arises.</p>', 'commentary': '<p>1.<b>di homines iniuros</b>] In the manuscripts we find the word <i>iniuriose</i> or <i>iniuriosae</i>, but it is probably an inspiration from the lemma of Nonius and a misreading of the original text of Naevius than a confirmed conjecture. Nonius quotes the line for the adverb <i>iniurie</i> and not for <i>iniuriose</i>, according to Traglia and Spaltenstein. The ancient editors (Mercerus, Scriverius) read <i>iniurios</i>, but this does not serve the metre (trochaic septenar). Lindsay places an obelus next to <i>iniuriose</i> as the word is plainly corrupt and he cannot see how to emend. Bothe’s correction <i>iniuros</i> is almost unanimously accepted and it is also adopted in the text as it complies with the metre. However, it is not confirmed either. The same holds for the emendation of Havet (1886α) <i>iniustos</i> which is mentioned in the editions of Lindsay and Warmington.</p>\n<p>Klussmann has objections for <i>iniuros</i> and read <i>iniurios</i> instead, following the ancient editors, although he recognizes its use in Plautus’ <i>Persa</i> 408:  <i>impure, inhoneste, iniure, inlex, labes popli</i> (insults to a <i>leno</i>). Marmorale admits that the adjective <i>iniuros</i> is unusual but also refers to the same passage from Plautus’ play. As Spaltenstein suggests, although this adjective appears only in these two texts, its formation reveals that it is not an unexpected or rare term. Ribbeck<sub>1</sub> proposes to remove the word <i>iniuros</i> completely and proposes <i>oderunt di homines: egone an illi iniure / facimus</i>  (7tro incomplete) but, according to Spaltenstein, in that way <i>oderunt</i> would be a later prosody, used like a poetic licence of hexametric poets when dealing with a cretic metrical foot and by imitation of the perfect tense in <i>-ere</i>, where the first <i>e</i> is long. The conjecture <i>illi</i> is also not a satisfactory solution as it does not correspond to the meaning of <i>iniurie facimus</i>.</p>\n<p>Mueller argued that the catalectic trochaic tetrameter can be served only if we read: <i>oderunt di homines iniustos. –egone an ille iniure facimus?</i>, but as the manuscripts have <i>homines iniuriose</i> and taking into account Plautus’ passage from <i>Persa</i>, maybe we should accept what Bothe corrected as <i>iniuros</i>. Apart from that, <i>iniure facimus</i> creates trochaic octanar. We should rather prefer <i>iniurie</i> (and not <i>iniure</i> as Mueller and Traglia suggested) and then change of verse, mainly because this is the word that Nonius has in his lemma. Furthermore, as Spaltenstein mentions, trochaic octonar is not suitable for dialogue sections like the one we assume is happening here and it rather suits a <i>canticum</i>, a chorus lyric section. One of the reasons that we cannot exclude theoretically this metre in Naevius’ tragedies is that in his fragments we encounter other unexpected metres as well (cf. frg. 32 TrRF).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, if we accept the octonar, we must assume that the verse belongs to the chorus (the followers of Lycurgus or the Bacchants). On the other hand, trochaic septenar is used in dialogues (rather than monologues). According to Dangel, this metre is suitable for a verse with strong emotional content (cf. frg. 33 TrRF). Spaltenstein disagrees with this assumption, reminding us that we are dealing with fragments and not the whole tragedy, so we cannot reach certain conclusions based on the rhythmic character of a verse and therefore we cannot follow general rules. For instance, although Daviault argues that the last scene (of comedies) is always written in trochaic septenar, we cannot apply this rule in this fragment because of its context and the fact that the final scenes of a play are usually very short and our fragments have little chance of belonging to them. In addition, trochaic septenar does not appear exclusively in the final scenes, but also in other parts of a play.</p>\n<p>Ribbeck compared <i>homines iniuros</i> to <i>genitorem iniustum</i> in Accius’ <i>Clytaemnestra</i> 245 (Wa.) where Clytaemnestra disputes with Electra about Agamemnom’s injustice: <i>matrem ob iure factum incilas, genitorem iniustum adprobas</i>.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>The eternal confrontation between gods and humans is the main theme in the specific fragment. Here, the first interlocutor of the assumed dialogue (and probably by extension Naevius) seems concerned about the tyrannical abuse of power on behalf of human beings and the consequent wrath of the god. According to Boyle, the warning against opposition to religions from the East along with the idea of justice and the need for appropriate treatment of the gods is apparent here. Furthermore, the influence of Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i> and the comparison with Pentheus’ madness and blindness of mind is obvious. We have to bear in mind that Naevius’ <i>Lycurgus</i> was displayed during an era in which the Roman elite’s main concern had to do with the spread of foreign religions and cults at Rome and, therefore, the need to define clearly what was Roman and what was not. In this tragedy, the Roman god Liber is identified with the Greek god of passionate ecstasy Bacchus, whose worship would have later been violently suppressed by the Roman Senate. This may have shocked the conservative and suspicious Roman audience as it may indicate Naevius’ suggestion for inclusiveness in Roman religion as well as tolerance of different gods and their worships. According to Manuwald, Lycurgus’s story (rather than Pentheus’ story) emphasizes the direct opposition of a god and a human with dire repercussions for the latter. </p>\n<p>Bothe was the first who made the distinction between the two persons speaking in the fragment. This is accepted by all modern editors. Before that, it was assumed that the lines were uttered by the same person as a sort of self-reflection about a moral injustice. It may seem inconceivable, but we can never be sure. A dialogue, however, is more proper indeed, even if we imagine a scene with three characters on stage and even if we do not exclude the possibility of a separate self-reflection in this context.</p> \n<p>The editors (Ribbeck, Warmington, Marmorale & Traglia) agree that we have a dialogue between two persons, as in frgg. 48 and 49 (33 and 21, TrRF) which are placed exactly before. Ribbeck and Traglia assume that the first one can be identified as Dionysus/Liber who after the capture of the Maenads has also been caught and brought in front of the king. The second person is Lycurgus who is now interrogating the god. Marmorale admits that the first speaker may not be Dionysus, but someone else, perhaps a follower of Lycurgus. Warmington also assumes a dialogue between Liber and Lycurgus, with the first one being captive and the second being mad, but he seems a little hesitant about the choice of Bacchus as the first speaker. Klotz does not give us any information about the interlocutors.</p>\n<p>It is rather certain that Lycurgus can be identified as speaker B. As for speaker A, we cannot be sure. Düntzer suggests the following: after the chorus has left the stage, the king remains alone and then Silenus (the companion of god Dionysus), who is restrained, approaches and vehemently criticizes Lycurgus. Then we have this dialogue as a possible reconstruction: <i>(Silenus) Pessimorum pessime, audax, ganeo, lurco, aleo/ Endocoepta per te temeriter face missa. Tu cave,/ Sis, tuam contendas iram contra ira Liberi./ Oderunt di homines iniuros. (Lycurgus) Egone an ille iniurie/ Facimus?</i>. Merula conjectures <i>hemones iniuriosos</i>. According to Klussmann, Düntzer wrongly associates the fragment with incertum 20 (Wa., <i>Unassigned fragments</i>), where there is no reference of the name of Lycurgus and it is rather a fragment of comedy than tragedy. Klussmann suggests that the first interlocutor might be a Thrace who has tried before (cf. frg. 30 TrRF) to reason Lycurgus and deter him from prosecuting Bacchus. Now, he tries again in vain to admonish his king for his wicked endeavours.</p>\n<p>Mette also attributes the line to a follower of Lycurgus (maybe a member of the chorus) who wants to discourage him from exposing himself to god’s fury. Pastorino argues that the first speaker is a member of Dionysus’ chorus which we assume to be present on stage and maybe represented here by the coryphaeus. This actually might be the case, if we take into account the severe tone of the warning, which seems to be uttered by someone who does not necessarily care about Lycurgus but rather wants to make a moral accusation and preludes king’s fall and punishment. Above all, the warning does not seem to come from a friend, a follower or a bodyguard of Lycurgus who would possibly have a milder and more respectful way of expression towards his king.</p>\n<p><i>Oderunt di</i> if uttered by Bacchus himself adds a tragic note, parallel to the one we find in Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i>. The comparison with Pentheus is indicated in Traglia’s edition regarding fragment 26 (TrRF). Both Lycurgus and Pentheus have acted unjustly towards the god, have provoked his <i>ira</i> and have been eventually punished cruelly by being lured out of the city, driven mad and being killed. Lycurgus, like Pentheus, does not consider his prisoner as the god himself, so he threatens him (cf. frg. 21 TrRF) and wants for him to feel his anger. Although the prisoner replies warningly (cf. frg. 33 TrRF), Lycurgus claim that the god was the one that acted unjustly. In <Bacchae> the god has not yet been revealed to Pentheus, so Dionysus might also be incognito in fragment 26, as Ribbeck suggested in his reconstruction. This does not mean, however, that we can exclude the possibility of a discussion between three people (Spaltenstein). Furthermore, in the context of a dialogue, the word <i>ille</i>, when uttered by the second speaker, cannot be referred to the first one. To be more specific, if we do have a dialogue between Lycurgus and Liber, why would Lycurgus refer to the god as <i>he</i> and not just as <i>you</i> directly? Therefore, this <i>ille</i> makes sense if we imagine Lycurgus on stage speaking to someone else and pointing to Liber who was also present, or rather referring to him and his injustice while thinking he was not there at all. In this hypothesis, the god has not yet been revealed and this intensifies the king’s madness. In any case, because of <i>ille</i> we cannot expect Liber to be Lycurgus’ interlocutor, but rather somebody else who tries to dissuade Lycurgus from acting improperly, an assumption that seems to find confirmation in Platus’ <i>Meneaechmi</i> 835-875 that features a woman and an old man who mistakenly believes that he has Apollo in front of him.</p> \n<p>The injustice to which speaker A is referring is probably the arrest of the foreign harmless Maenads, the followers of Bacchus, by the king’s soldiers. Lycurgus, on the other hand, claim his right to defend his territory and his people after the invasion of the god and his Bacchants in the city whose foreign licentiousness and delirium had provoked disgust. Therefore, as Pastorino and Mueller suggest, the king tries to justify himself by accusing Liber of being unjust and unrespectful. He believes that the hubris had begun by the god and not by him. According to Traglia, Lycurgus asseverate that he defended the moral common good in opposition to the orgiastic culture of foreign divinity. In <i>Bacchae</i>, we encounter a similar justification in Pentheus’ speech and behaviour. Naevius might have an ideological reason to talk about Bacchus in this way in front of the Roman audience. However, as Spaltenstein points out, even if Traglia is right, the context in frg. 26 (TrRF) is too general to support such analysis. But, vice versa, exactly because of its general character, we cannot deny the assumption either. Moreover, the arrest of the harmless foreigners by Lycurgus may be an implication about royal arbitrariness, to which Latins might have been more sensitive.</p> \n<p><i>Oderunt</i> placed at the beginning of the first line, probably for emphasis, highlights the fact that gods loathe unjust humans who act wrongfully as a result of blindness of their mind, so they punish them in order to restore the natural order of <i>cosmos</i>. This is a common <i>topos</i> in ancient Greek tragedy. In Lycurgus’ case, the cause of his imminent punishment is the non-recognition of the divinity of Bacchus and, also, the arrogant demand to compete against a god, which clearly indicates an act of hubris. This hubris is intensified by his response to the warning which he totally ignores and, even, goes further by questioning god’s justice. We may also sense an irony in Lycurgus’s rhetorical (?) question. Keeping in mind the general context of Lycurgus’ fury, his attitude should not surprise us, although he would eventually come to understand his error. His victory is ephemeral. Liber soon sets himself free and wreaks revenge (Pastorino).</p>\n<p>A similar warning against human opposition to a god’s will can be traced in the lost tragedy <i>Bacchae</i> of Aeschylus that was part of a tetralogy about the legend of god Dionysus. <i>Bacchae</i> is maybe an alternative title for <i>Bassarai</i> or <i>Pentheus</i>. For sure, the remaining fragment we have belongs to the context of <i>Bacchae</i>: <i>τό τοι κακόν ποδῶκες ἔρχεται βροτοῖς καί τ᾿ ἀμπλάκημαͺτῷ περῶντι τὴν θέμιν</i> (frg. 22 R.) Despite the scarcity of information, we can assume that the fault (<i>ἀμπλάκημα</i>) of those who turn against the justice of gods may be a reference to Pentheus’ hubris who has exceeded the human limits and violated the established divine order of things, exactly like Lycurgus in Naevius’ tragedy.</p>\n<p>Another useful parallel is found again in the lost tetralogy of Aeschylus and, specifically, in the tragedy <i>Hedonoi</i> in which we see Lycurgus confronting his captive, Bacchus, in a way that reveals arrogance against the god: <i>ποδαπός ὁ γύννις ; τίς πάτρα ; τίς ἡ στολή;</i> (frg. 61 TGrF III).</p>\n<p>Τhe whole dialogue in fragment 26 may be part of a narration of the events that took place outside the city, in the mountains, where Lycurgus was lured to or chased away. A messenger, probably an eyewitness, is to be envisaged as standing in front of the royal palace and quoting these. As Bednarek suggests and despite what all scholars assume, there is no clear evidence of Liber’s captivity, interrogation and liberation in the remaining fragments of Naevius’ tragedy. This annotation supports the argument that the first speaker in the fragment is not Liber, but someone else.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina', 'text': '<p>Nonius quotes these lines from Naevius’ <i>Lycurgus</i> in his dictionary <i>De compendiosa doctrina</i> within a definition of <b>iniurie</b> as a term synonym for <i>iniuriose</i>, meaning ‘unjustly’:</p> <p>iniurie dictum pro iniuriose.

If we adopt Spaltenstein’s interpretation, namely that Lycurgus is commanding his guards to catch the bacchants in this fragment,  he might simply give the command to “some of them”, and give others a different task. However, <i>alii</i> is attested in none of the extant manuscripts. Furthermore, <i>alis</i> is not incomprehensible either, specifically as a form of <i>ala</i> within the context of the <i>volucres</i> in the second line. </p>\n<p><b>alios</b> ] Warmington, Ribbeck<sup>2</sup> and Ribbeck<sup>3</sup> all conjecture <i>altos</i>, even though it is not attested in any of the extant manuscripts. However, it is true that <i>alios</i> poses some issues, as Spaltenstein explains: if <i>alios</i> should be taken with <i>saltus</i> and the speaker is referring to “other places”, to what places should these be compared? In contrast, <i>altos saltus</i> is a generic way of describing mountains, which would go well with <i>sublime</i>.<p> \n<p><b>sublime</b> ] Most manuscripts have <i>sublimen</i>. However, Spaltenstein mentions that this is a rare archaic form, and that it would make more sense to print <i>sublime</i>, as this form is also attested in Ennius’ works. Also interesting is Marmorale’s conjecture, who prints <i>[…] alis sublimes saltus alites</i>. According to Spaltenstein, however, this conjecture derives from an uncertain manuscript, and should therefore not receive too much attention.<p> \n', 'reconstruction': '<p> Warmington, Ribbeck<sup>2</sup>, Ribbeck<sup>3</sup>, Klotz and Marmorale all assign this fragment to Naevius’ <i>Lycurgus</i>, probably on the basis of the context: this fragment derives from Nonius’ <i>De Compendiosa Doctrina</i>, where Nonius explicitly states that it is part of Naevius’ <i>Lycurgus</i>.\n<p> The main verb in these two lines is a second person plural, probably an imperative.  This indicates that the speaker is addressing multiple people, and possibly giving them a command. The fragment does not explicitly state who the speaker is. Warmington does not specify who the speaker is, but Marmorale and Spaltenstein are convinced that it is Lycurgus, which indeed seems to be the most logical option: he is the most likely character to issue a command, given his authority.</p>\n<p> Düntzer thinks <i>bipedes volucres</i> refers to actual birds, but this view gets no support from Marmorale, Spaltenstein and Warmington, who regard <i>bipedes volucres</i> as a metaphor for the bacchants. In this case, the bacchants are being compared to two-footed birds. This does seem to be the most sensible option, especially when we take Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i>, vv. 748 into account, where the Bacchants are also compared to birds. Furthermore, the epithet <i>bipedes</i> does not make much sense when the speaker is referring to actual birds, as all birds are two-footed. According to Spaltenstein, we should rather think of <i>bipedes</i> in the sense of “humanlike”, as humans are sometimes (jokingly) called two-footers. This could imply that <i>bipedes volucres</i> should be understood as some kind of derogatory joke of Lycurgus, who reduces the bacchants to “humanlike birds” by calling them <i>bipedes volucres</i>. Then again, it is also very well possible that the epithet <i>bipedes</i> is merely used in a poetic sense and does not carry any further implications. </p>\n<p> The context of the passage suggests that <i>inlicite</i> should be interpreted in a similar way as the verb <i>inlaequeare</i>, which means “to ensnare”. This could help make sense of <i>lino</i>, which, combined with the image of birds that the speaker sketches, most likely refers to a net used to catch birds.</p>\n<p>Keeping all of the above in the back of our minds, we may now possibly reconstruct the addressees of this fragment. According to Spaltenstein, Lycurgus could very well be speaking to his guards: he commands them to catch the bacchants, so that they <i>linquant lumina</i>, a euphemism for death. This seems like a probable interpretation of the fragment, especially because it resonates with Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i>, which was probably an important source of Naevius’ <i>Lycurgus</i>. \n\n\n', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': 'De Compendiosa Doctrina', 'text': '<p> Quoted only once by Nonius in <i>De Compendiosa Doctrina. </i></p>  <p> Nonius quotes these lines in the context of an explanation of the verb <i>inlicire</i>, which according to him has a similar meaning to the verb <i>inlaqueare</i></p>.  <p> inlicire est proprie inlaqueare.

Most editions place this fragment as the sixth one. TRF has it as the third fragment. A bit earlier than most but still at the beginning of the play. Warmington on the other hand places this fragment about a little over halfway as the sixteenth of twenty-five fragments.

Marm. on the other hand preserves <i>tum</i>. Lattanzi argues that substituting <i>cum</i> for <i>tum</i> is unnecessary since <i>cum</i> without an ablative would defend itself. <i>Tum</i>, according to Spaltenstein, could have the meaning of referring to the future. This would also support the idea that <i>ducite</i> is meant to be <i>ducito</i>. The editors using <i>cum</i> use it as an instrumental. This however does not hold up since <i>cum</i> as an instrumental often refers to physical or moral characteristics, which is not the case here. </p>\n<p><b>ducite</b>] the codex Bambergensis transmits <i>ducito</i> instead of <i>ducite</i>. This alternation would mean that the meaning of the sentence slightly changes. The imperative would first of all be aimed towards a single person instead of multiple people. This means that Lycurgus (who is probably the speaker) addresses one person, maybe the captain of the guard, instead of multiple people, meaning all the guards. Second of all the imperative would no longer be a present but a future. This would support the idea of preserving <i>tum</i> instead of <i>cum</i> since that word also refers to the future. </p>\n<p><b>quadrupedis</b>] Spaltenstein argues that <i>quadrupedis</i> is ‘parasite’ and <i>quadrupedis</i> should therefore be corrected to <i>quadrupedes</i>.</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p> This fragment starts with a plural imperative. The addressees are commanded to take away a certain group of people to a certain place.  The people who are meant to be taken away are said to be sharp-tounged and stupid like four footers. From these statements you can conclude that the speaker has an animosity against those people. From this fragment we can also deduce that there is a hierarchy of power. The speaker is of the highest power. They command the addressees to perform a task which indicates that the speaker has authority over them. At their turn, the addressees must hold power over the group of people since they have the power to take them away. </p>\n<p> It is assumed by most editors that the feminine <i>mutas</i> are the maenads. Ribbeck and Deichgräber believe that <i>quadrupedis</i> refers to the way that the maenads’ hands and feet are bound together. Deichgräber refers to Terence (<i>Andria</i> 865) in which this bound-up position is mentioned as <i>quadrupedis constringito</i>. This theory however is not foolproof since the maenads are supposed to be guided somewhere and that is hardly possible when a person is tied up at hands and feet. Marmorale suggest that the person speaking must have seen the maenads in their frenzy walking on all fours. This in reference to fragment 30-32. Some also suggested that Lycurgus, who is most likely to be the speaker, orders his guards to fetch some real animals for sacrifice, but this does not add up with the statement that the <i>mutas</i> are <i>cum argutis linguis</i>. </p>\n<p> There are some difficulties with the statement that the maenads are <i>mutas</i>. Klussmann suggests that the maenads are using instruments that produce animal-like sounds like in fragment 57 of the <i>Edonoi</i>. A plausible suggestion but one with a flaw. In this fragment the instruments are played by the male followers of Dionysus. Klussmann also adds that the maenads may have really mooed themselves. In the <i>Bacchae</i> 691 there is also a reference to mooing of animals but the maenads hear these moos and don’t produce these sounds themselves. Spaltenstein adds that the maenads producing Bacchic cries can be making incomprehensible sound all the while still having a sharp tongue. Another suggestion is that the maenads may have not only been tied up but also gagged, which would explain their incomprehensible sounds. </p>\n<p><i>Eo</i> probably refers to a prison.

This fragment can also refer to a dialogue between Orestes and Pylades, with the assumption that Orestes sends Pylades away before the act of revenge ( Mette, 1964, 97). Ribbeck (1897, 247) also supports that Pylades is the addressee. Warmington (1936, 220) supports that the question introduced with <i>quando</i> implies the neglection of a friend in the past and speculates that this friend can possibly be Oiax or another minor character. </p>\n", 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus ', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina, vol III, Lindsay, ed.Teubner', 'text': '<p>Nonius Marcellus presents two examples of the use of the adverb <i>amiciter</i> instead of the use of the adverb <i>amice</i>, one from Plautus and one from Pacuvius. </p>  NON. 821 L.

Cic. <i>Brut.</i> 78) or another of his plays. However, even if the Accian line is obviously the words of a tyrant – all our sources indicate that – the Ennian line is more ambiguous. It could be a word of warning about or to a tyrant, or it could be the tyrant’s own paranoid assessment. </p>  <p><i>Metre</i><br>The line is written in the metre of trochaic septenarii. The line’s rhythm is full of spondees and resolutions: the anceps syllables produce longs and a couple of the long syllables are resolved into two shorts. None of the anceps syllables consists of a single short. There is an elision at the diaresis after the second foot as well. All this extends the feel of the length of the line and perhaps adds to its sententiousness. The second relative pronoun <i>quem</i> becomes the antecedent in the accusative-infinite construction <i>(eum) periisse expetit</i>, ‘he wishes him dead’.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>The similarity with the Accian line <i>oderint dum metuant</i> was noticed by Ribbeck. Accius’ line is one of the most famous verses from Roman Republican tragedy and has been quoted at least 10 times in ancient literature. According to e.g. Cic. <i>Off.</i> 1.97 the words, in Accius’ play, were spoken by Atreus. On the basis of their similiarity with Accius’ line, Ribbeck suggested Ennius’ verse were the words of Atreus to his <i>satelles</i>. However, both of the apparent receptions of Ennius’ line – in Ovid’s <i>Amores</i> and Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i> (see the commentary below) – are assessments by a second party of powerful person’s position, which might suggest that it is spoken by Atreus or to Atreus, or even shared as part of a hemistichal dialogue, such as appears as a famous feature of Seneca’s tragedy.</P> <p>La Penna (La Penna (1972) 15) was less confident that Seneca based his plot on Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i>, citing Jocelyn’s arguments (Jocelyn (1967) 415-9) that Ennius’ script was actually set in the court of Thesprotus, after the events of the feast, but La Penna still thought that the fragment belonged in a <i>Thyestes</i>. Nevertheless, the only character who displays actual cruelty, even if the play included events at Thesprotus, is Atreus. It has to be about a figure who exerts the kind of power that a group of people hate. It is a general statement, so it could be spoken by almost anyone, including the chorus (except the metre would make this unlikely), or some outsider. </p> <p>It lacks the dramatic power of the Accian line, which perhaps offers some explanation why Accius’ line was quoted so often, and Ennius’ line only once by Cicero in a philosophical work (not one of his law-court speeches).</p>  <p>The words are echoed in Ovid’s Amores 2.2 and Seneca’s tragedy Thyestes. In Ovid’s poem, the words are addressed to a slave Bagoe (a pseudonym based on the name of two Persian eunuch courtiers) the chaperone of the girl Ovid wants to seduce. Ovid addresses him as <i>o custos</i> – Bagoe is thus in a position of power over the success of the poet’s love-scheming, but the poet is trying to convince Bagoe that he is vulnerable and has plenty to lose at the poet’s hands. As Booth notes in her commentary ad loc., there is a “note of controlled menace” in Ovid’s words (<i>si sapis, o custos, odium, mihi crede, mereri / desine; quem metuit quisque, perisse cupit</i>, <i>Am.</i> 2.2.9-10) which contrasts with the tone of the rest of the poem. It would perhaps be going too far to impute a similar sense of menace to Ennius’ words, since the sentiment seems to be expressed as a more neutral warning in Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i>.</p> <p>In Seneca’s tragedy, the sentiment is part of a dialogue, in which the <i>satelles</i>, Atreus’ attendant, tries to keep his master from taking revenge on his brother Thyestes. The dialogue starts in the style of a <i>domina-nutrix</i>-scene: the <i>satelles</i> cites plenty of general statements in order to help Atreus change his mind. In this context, he argues that fear may force men to praise, yet, at the same time, fear will drive these men to hate (<i>quos cogit metus | laudare, eosdem reddit inimicos metus</i>, <i>Thy.</i> 207-208). Yet, in the course of the dialogue, the <i>satelles’</i> attitude seems to change. After several attempts to change his master’s mind, he swears loyalty to him, helps to work out the details of his plans, and promises that he won’t reveal these plans to anyone else (see <i>Thy.</i> 334-335). The <i>satelles</i> is clearly afraid of Atreus. That said, the line, <i>ex post</i>, can also be read as a warning, which addresses the <i>satelles</i>’ potential to build up hatred toward Atreus: if the <i>satelles’</i> words suggest loyalty, his alleged loyalty will be based on fear and all the more demonstrate his hate.</p>', 'status': 'Incertum', 'context': [], 'lines': [{'line_number': '163', 'text': 'quem metuunt oderunt; quem quisque odit periisse expetit'}], 'linked_fragments': ['0f99c83f73c44850831d2db371b7b0cf', 'aefe9f581fdf42d886f948dacf2c6e83', '1822a48243b6409ab56574437520635f', '0c300a2179cd4e87a3f52daf85b36191'], 'lock': 1, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>

This question could also be placed at a moment after Agamemnon’s death, in which case we could image Electra ironically addressing her mother on the sight of Agamemnon’s corpse (Ribbeck 1875, 31). Regarding the sight of Agamemnon’s body Waszink and Antonelli have suggested a verbal dispute between Aegisthus and Clytemnestra.

There are three texts that cause us to pause and consider this suggestion. In Festus’ lexicon, we have an issue with Festus’ lemma, since although Festus quotes the line exactly as Cicero and Probus do, he introduces his quotation of the Ennian line with <i>sublimem</i>. In Paulus’ excerpta of Festus’ lexicon, in a good manuscript, <i>L</i>, the reading <i>sublimen</i> is found instead of <i>sublimem</i> as found in most manuscripts, apart from <i>T</i> and <i>I</i> which have <i>sublime</i> . Finally, some manuscripts of Apuleius, an author who quotes the Ennian line without any introductory note or comment in <i>de Mundo</i>, contain the reading <i>aspice hoc sublimen candens...</i>.</p> <p>It is strange that Festus uses <i>sublimem</i> in his lemma that introduces this fragment, an accusative masculine adjectival form, while in the Ennian line, we read <i>sublime</i>, an adverbial form. We would expect <i>sublime</i>, the neuter singular adjectival form, in Festus’ lemma, in order for it to agree with <i>elatum</i> in his definition.</P><p>In the <i>codex Leidensis</i> of Paulus the reading <i>sublimen</i> is found instead of <i>sublimem</i> in Paulus’ definition: <i>sublimen est in altitudinem elatum; id autem dicitur a limine superiore, quia supra nos est.</i>. However, this could quite probably be a scribal slip: the scribe may have been inspired by Paulus’ etymological explanation of <i>sublime</i> from <i>a limine</i>.<p>Separately, a few generally inferior manuscripts of Apuleius record the form <i>sublimen</i> for the Ennian fragment itself.</p><p>Considering the evidence of Festus, Paulus and Apuleius together, the possibility cannot be excluded that <i>sublimen</i> was the form originally used by Ennius. This would still be an adjectival form, but an archaic one. If this hypothesis is adopted, then the resulting predominant readings across the different manuscript traditions have occurred because this form has subsequently either caused confusion for some scribes, or been changed to the contemporary adverbial form <i>sublime</i>.  If it was used adverbially, it would not alter the interpretation of the line. However, and probably likelier, it could also be that all of these things (<i>sublimem</i> in Festus’ lemma, <i>sublimen</i> in the <i>L</i> manuscript of Paulus, and <i>sublimen</i> in some Apuleian manuscripts are due to independent scribal errors, rather than some artefacts of <i>sublimen</i> being the form Ennius used. The fact that the other quotation Festus cites is from Virgil’s <i>Georgics</i> 242, where the form is certainly <i>sublimis</i> probably supports the argument that that <i>sublime</i>, not <i>sublimen</i> was Festus’ lemma. See further the notes on Festus’ text  and Apuleius’ text in the Context Author section.</p><p><b>Iovem]</b> Thyestes and Atreus are ultimately descended from Zeus/Jupiter by Tantalus and Pelops, so this might be part of a genealogical commentary, rather than merely an astronomical observation.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>Cicero in <i>De natura deorum</i> and Probus in his commentary on Virgil’s <i>Eclogues</i> attribute this fragment to Ennius, and Festus attributes it specifically to his <i>Thyestes.</i></p><p>Interestingly enough, the two quoting authors who have an interest in religion, Cicero and Apuleius, read invocant (rather than vocant), ascribing a religious dimension to the line: people call upon Jupiter, the god of lightning. Meanwhile, the grammatici Probus and Festus, who have a partiality to etymologies and naming, transmit the reading vocant, not invocant, which turns the line into an explanation of hoc sublime candens.  Since the readings scan the same, due to invocant eliding with quem, both are possible. If Paulus, in his statement <i>sublimen est in altitudinem elatum; id autem dicitur a limine superiore, quia supra nos est</i>accurately reflects the etymological interest Festus took in the first half of the line, in <i>hoc sublime candens</i>, then Festus saw in Ennius’ description an explanation of Jupiter’s position as beyond some kind of threshold, between mortals (<i>nos</i>) and gods. Perhaps this tells us more about the quoting authors than what Ennius himself wrote. Or it could allow us to draw conclusions about the Ennian line: that the original context of Ennius’ line suggested that there was a <i>limen</i>, a threshold between mortal and divine activites. To go one step further, we could speculate that the line might critically reflect on Atreus’ attitude towards divinity - in the Senecan reception of the myth, Atreus is presented as a character who wants to supersede the gods. Alternately, there could be an ironic, or even sarcastic, dimension to the line: that the speaker is pointing out that everyone is calling (vocant) or invoking (invocant) Jupiter, and yet all he does is shine uselessly and without a care, but failing to intercede in the mortal world - a quite Epicurean vision of divine inactivity. An argument for Ennian interest in the philosophy of religion could be supported by Ennian fragments such as <i>TrRF</i> frg. 82 and famously the fragments of Pacuvius’ <i>Chryses</i> (Schierl frgg. 76-81, and esp. 77)</p><p>The line is in the metre of trochaic septenarii.

Similarly, Vossius (1620),  Duentzer (1837) and Mercier (1583)  with their emendations also introduce a trochaic meter. </p>\n\n<p><b>arvas</b>] Originally an adjective <i>arvus-a-um</i>. Etymologically connected with the verb <i>arare</i>, which signifies land cultivated by the human factor ( Spaltenstein 1199 & 1200). It can be said that the civilised world that is symbolically represented here by <i>arvas</i> is violently destroyed by the primitive and ecstatic  power of the Bacchae (Klussmann 1843) & ( Ribbeck<sup>RT</sup>).  Another possible opinion expressed by Schauer is that  <i>arvas</i> is related to vineyards cultivated by the followers of Liber and destroyed by Lycurgus' command.</p> \n\n<p><b>[...]</b>]Based on the assumption that an iambic hexameter is applied here, a lacuna is spotted. Ribbeck (1875) proposes <i> Liberi ⟨ sunt⟩ </i> as a probable text that properly fills the metric gap. <i>Liberi</i> can have a double interpretation. On the one hand, it can signify the Bacchae, the followers of God Liber. On the other hand, it can also be written with a lower-case letter, as an adjective introducing the idea of freedom. Notably, its Greek correspondent word is the proper noun <i>Βάκχοι</i>. Mueller also perceives <i>liberi</i> as an adjective (Mueller, 1885). Strzelecki (1947) prefers the capital letter, writing <i>Libero</i>. The above two interpretations can be interconnected in the sense that the Bacchae represent the deliberating savagery that makes the civilized norms deconstruct. The ambivalence between <i>Liberi</i> and <i>liberi</i>  can also be interpreted as a wordplay (Spaltenstein, 1194).  Moreover, Spaltenstein rejects the opinion that it was anticipated by the audience to decode the wordplay, as this mostly seems to be a modern literary interpretation (Spaltenstein, 1195). </p> \n\n<p><b>quaque</b>] Used as an indefinite relative pronoun. Most recent editors do not accept <i>quaqua</i> or <i>quacumque</i> of ancient editions and retain <i>quaque</i>, even if there are no parallel literary uses of <i>quaque</i> in this sense attested ( Spaltenstein 1197). </p>\n\n<p><b>opterunt</b>] From the verb <i>obtero</i>, with the meaning to destroy, to condemn, to break into pieces. Reinforces the context of destructive, damaging action ( Spaltenstein 1199). </p>\n", 'reconstruction': "<p> This fragment probably belongs to the messenger's narration. This narration is placed at the beginning of the play as it constitutes the initial trigger point of the tragic plot, introducing the rivalry between the conflicting poles of civilized secular order and divine uncivilized ecstatic savagery. The speaker is the messenger, the addressee is possibly Lycurgus or the citizens of Edones and the content refers to the invasion of the Bacchae and Satyrs in their land and their series of destructive actions, particularly, the pillage of the cultivated land ( Ribbeck, 1871), (Marmorale,1950 p.192), (Warmington, 1936), (Spaltenstein 1190). Marmorale (1950) has noted that it might have been impossible for the messenger to understand the identity of the Bacchae from the very first time he encountered them. Nevertheless, a counter-argument is that the messenger is probably familiar with the identity of the Bacchae, as he might have heard them calling the name of their God Liber. A parallel text can be found in <i> EUR., IT 249</i>. Furthermore, another counter-argument to Marmorale can be that the verse is attributed to a follower of Liber who notices the arrival of Lycurgus. But, in this case, the placement of the fragment in the tragedy corpus has to be altered (Spaltenstein, 1196). </p>\n\n<p> Another less possible interpretation by Mercier (1583), Vossius (1620), Duntzer (1847) and Bothe (1837) is that the people who are committing the destruction are Lycurgus' people, the army and the citizens of Edones. In particular, they are destroying the vineyards that have been created by the Bacchae and that represent their inclination to sensual, ephemeral pleasure. In this case, the messenger is addressing his narration to the Bacchae and Satyrs, Liber's followers. As Klussmann supports, it is doubtful how possible it was for the Bacchae to have already cultivated vineyards by the time of their arrival in the city (Klussmann 1843), but helpful divine intervention from Liber is always a possible answer (Spaltenstein, 1192). In any case, the scenario in which the Bacchae are devoting themselves to the cultivation of the land is contradictory to their savagery and it undermines the substantial conflict between civilization and destructive ecstatic pleasure that is tragedy's epicentre. </p>  \n", 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus ', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina,vol. 1, Lindsay, Ed.

Müller 25), but if it is negative or ironic it could be used mockingly of Aegisthus (Schierl 2012 264). Since Orestes is disguised as a slave in this tragedy, and Aegisthus is more infamous than well-renowned, I find the proposal that the statement is ironic and perhaps mocking to be convincing.

D’Anna (1967) places the fragment just before Fr. 102 and 104, suggesting instead that Aegisthus is referring to Orestes after he has been warned of his plot. However, the extra emphasis placed on the particle hic (to hic-ce) might suggest that Warmington and d’Anna are wrong in situating the statement in a private conversation, pointing to the likelihood that it occurs during a confrontation between the speaker and the man referred to. </p>\n\n\n', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius Marcellus ', 'location': 'De Compendiosa Doctrina', 'text': 'Nonius 588 L.

The editors ascribe the lines to different moments in the play. Ribbeck<sup>1</sup> thinks the fragment is spoken after the burning of the palace of Lycurgus by Liber, as he places this fragment after the fragment in which Vulcanus is mentioned (frg. 24 TrRF). Marmorale and Klotz also place the fragment at this position (frg. 21 Marm, frg. 46 Kl). Warmington ascribes the fragment to the same moment but places fragment 39 of the TrRF (frg. 54 Warm.) between those fragments. Klussmann places the fragment after the lines in which some people are “duplicated” after the arrival of somebody (frg. 38 TrRF). He reasons that that it were the satellites of Lycurgus who flighted for the arrival of Bacchus after they had killed the Bacchants and that the words of fragment 23 of the TrRF are subsequently spoken by symphatizer of the Bacchants who wishes Lycurgus to be punished by the gods. In Ribbeck<sup>2/3</sup> the fragment is moved to an earlier moment in the play, since it is assigned to the moment when a messenger calls for Lycurgus in order to announce to him the arrival of Liber. The TrRF places the fragment (frg. 23 TrRF) also at the beginning, after a soldier has told about the manner Liber was disturbing daily life, causing people to play on the banks. However, Liber would victoriously have called for Lycurgus to show him his first revenge and to harm him even more. Diehl only ascribes the fragment to a tragic play but does not try to make a reconstruction of the order of the fragments of the <i>Lycurgus</i>.</p> \n', 'apparatus': '<p>1.

Ribbeck</i> .</p>\n', 'commentary': '<p><b>proinde huc Dryante</b>] The manuscripts read <i>proindustriantte</i>, which does not make sense. As <i>pro</i> is usually followed by an ablative and according to Lewis and Short (1966) 1447 the combination of <i>pro</i> with accusative only occurs in late Latin, the reading <i>pro industriam te</i> found by Mueller in G seems also to be corrupt. The coniecture <i>pro industria ne te</i> made by Aldus and Stephanus solves the problem with the accusative after <i>pro</i>. However, by retaining <i>te</i> the speaker of this line refers to somebody who is already present. This is problematic as <i>te</i> then corresponds with <i>regem prognatum</i>. This likely refers to king Lycurgus, whose name is mentioned in the following line. From <i> Lycurgum cette</i>, we can deduce that Lycurgus is not present yet and thus could not be addressed with <i>te</i>. Reading <i>Dryante</i> for the part <trianntte> could be a sensible alternative, since Lycurgus was considered to be the son of Dryas. Nevertheless, Iunius’ emendation <i>proin Dryante</i> is problematic since <i>proin</i> should be read disyllabic to fit the metre (senarius iambicus) but according to Lewis and Short (1966) 1462 <i>proin</i> usually is monosyllabic. Therefore, the reading <i>proinde huc Dryante</i> with disyllabic proinde as proposed by Ribbeck should be preferred. This reading is followed by all later editors although some changes in the spelling of the spelling of <i>Dryante</i> are made.</p>\n<p><b>Dryante</b>] Diehl and Klotz in their editions adopt the suggestion by Leo (1910) 22 to read Triante. He prefers this reading since in Latin usually avoids the onset dr. This onset did not occur in ancient Latin words and the combination dr in Greek loanwords was probably pronounced tr (eg.drachma pronounced as trachma). As in the manuscripts we find <i>triantte</i> instead of <i>driantte</i> the reading <i>Triante</i> might be preferred. The choice for y or i is arbitrary, since both graphemes render the Greek upsilon.</p>\n<p><b>cette</b>] This word is the reason Nonius quotes these lines. The word originates from the imperative <i>cedo</i> which plural <i>cedate</i> is contracted to <i>cette</i>. As Nonius himself states, the word has the same meaning as <i>dicite</i> (tell!) or <i>date</i> (bring!). As the context of the fragment is lost, it is impossible to decide which meaning id used here.</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>Nonius in his <i>De compendiosa doctrina</i> (Non. p. 84, 31-34 <i>Merc.</i> = 120 <i>Li.</i>) attribute this fragment to Naevius’ Lycurgus. This seems plausible, since Lycurgus himself is mentioned in the second line (<i>Lycurgum cette</i>). Hence, all editors except Diehl ascribe the fragment to the <i>Lycurgus</i> of Naevius. Since Diehl does not order Naevius’ tragic fragments according to their play, he does not attribute the fragment to the <i>Lycurgus</i> explicitly.</p>\n<p>From the fragment itself we can deduce that at least two people are on stage. The adverb <i>cette</i> is the plural of the imperative <i>cedo</i> and should therefore refer to more than one person. The number of persons present on stage is partly dependent on the interpretation of <i>cette</i>. Nonius states that this word could have the same meaning as both <i>dicite</i> and <i>date</i>. If the word is interpreted as <i>dicite</i>, the speakers were probably exhorting themselves to shout. This would require that there were at least two persons on stage. Duentzer is the only editor who seems to interpret <i>cette</i> in this manner. He thinks the words are spoken by a chorus consisting of the followers of Lycurgus when the king comes back from hunting.</p>\n<p>If the word is interpreted as <i>date</i> there should at least be three persons on stage since somebody is giving an order to at least two other persons. From the fact that those persons are ordered to bring Lycurgus, it can be deduced that Lycurgus was not yet on stage. Spengel (1899) 392, who proposes the reading <i>proin dis Dryante</i>, suggests that the speaker of these lines request that Lycurgus is handed over to the gods to be punished. He does not specify who is speaking to whom but his argument suggests that the lines were spoken after Lycurgus had imprisoned Bacchus and killed the Bacchants. Following this interpretation, the speaker should sympathize with the Bacchants or at least disapprove with the deeds of Lycurgus. Therefore the speaker most likely was a bacchant or even a chorus of Bacchants. If the latter would be true, the chorus was probably not addressing specific people but uttering a more general wish that Lycurgus may be punished by the gods.</p>\n<p>From the editors that read <i>proinde huc Dryante</i> with or without a variation in the spelling of <i>Dryante</i>, Bothe and Klussmann think that the words are spoken by Bacchus to the attendants of Lycurgus after they have left their king. Bacchus would have requested king Lycurgus in exchange for peace. This interpretation fits partly with the story told by Apollodorus (3.5), as in this story the Edonians indeed handed over Lycurgus to Bacchus by bounding him on mount Parnassus. However, in Apollodorus’ version of the story, not Bacchus himself but an oracle declared that the Edonians should extradite Lycurgus. Furthermore, Diodorus Siculus (3.65) tells in his version of the story that Lycurgus was not handed over but was captured by Bacchus after he and his army had destroyed Thrace. Wacholder, Marmorale and Traglia also ascribe the lines to Bacchus but they think that these are victoriously spoken by Bacchus after he has burnt down Lycurgus palace. He would triumphantly have asked for the king so that he could show his revenge to him. However, <i>Dryante regem prognatum</i> is a quite respectful designation for Lycurgus. This makes it unlikely that the lines are spoken by Bacchus or somebody else who wants to punish Lycurgus. Furthermore, it suggests that the speaker has a lower standing than the king. As this speaker is giving orders to other people, the addressees were probably from the same or an even lower standing. This corresponds with the interpretation of Ribbeck (1875) 85. He places the fragment more in the beginning of the play. A messenger would have spoken these words to ask for the king since he wanted to announce that the Bacchants had arrived. The addressees could then have been the satellites of Lycurgus, who might or might not have constituted the chorus.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [{'author': 'Nonius', 'location': 'De compendiosa doctrina, 31-34 Mercerus = 120 Lindsay', 'text': '<p>Quoted by Nonius in <i>De compendiosa doctrina.</i>:</p> <p>The text is quoted in the context of Nonius’ statement that <i>cette<i/> comes from <i>cedo</i> and has a meaning similar to <i>dicite</i> (speak!) or <i>date</i> (give!):</p> <p>cette significat dicite vel date ab eo quod cedo.

The most famous of these was from the Iliad, ἵππων μ‘ ὠκυπόδων ἀμφὶ κτύπος οὔατα βάλλει (Hom. <i>Il.</i> 10, 535, ‘the sound of quickfooted horses strikes my ears’) and comes from Nestor’s speech announcing the return of Odysseus and Diomedes. Perhaps Ennius’ line also has the diegetic role of announcing an arrival on stage. Boyle, who in general is interested in the lesser generic differences (compared to Greek drama) between comedy and tragedy on the Roman stage, notes that the words would certainly not be out of place in comedy.</p>  <p><b>pedum pulsu]</b> Note the alliteration in <i>pedum pulsu</i> (further examples in Jocelyn ad loc.), which is characteristic for Ennius’ style and links the verse directly to his <i>Annals</i>, frg. 1 Sk (see reconstruction). <i>pulsu</i> could also suggest something more sinister than either running or dancing, such as a march or a pursuit.</p>  <p>In Seneca’s version of the play, before Atreus’ coup de théâtre, the actor playing Thyestes delivers a monody after the feast, a melancholy song that quickly moves from festive jubilation to mournful lament (on this monody, see particularly Meltzer (1988) 312-315). It is possible that such a monody – perhaps not quite so bittersweet and ironic – was found in Ennius’ play, and frg. 138 refers to its accompanying dance (a contrast with Seneca, where, to judge from Thyestes’ words, the Senecan Thyestes seems to lie near-comatose, although there are no explicit stage directions). Frg. 136 is also a line which might belong to such a monody, which the majority of commentators attribute to Thyestes (although Jocelyn suggests it could be sung by either Thyestes or Atreus, and Boyle favours Atreus).</p>', 'reconstruction': '<p>This line must belong to a single speaker (<i>meas</i>) or a group of speakers (the chorus), who refers to themselves in the first person singular, who perceive/s a sound of ‘feet’, i.e. someone(?) approaching. Only a few editors and commentators have hazarded guesses about a hypothetical context for this fragment, and even these are vague. Ribbeck, seeing in them a certain dramatic excitement, suggests that they could be spoken by Atreus or another character to announce Thyestes’ arrival on stage after the feast off-stage. Boyle suggests that it might be Atreus’ arrival. Segura Morena suggested they were the words of Thyestes himself, without explanation. Warmington, as part of his assumption that Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i> also included an episode at the court of King Thesprotus in Sicyon, thought that this line was delivered by the chorus as Thyestes rushed in, having fled from Atreus and the palace at Mycenae in the wake of the macabre dinner. So, where some have been brave enough to make suggestions, these have been along the lines that an entry is being marked, although no commentator is particularly sure about when, where or whose entry this might be and who is speaking. The line could be announcing someone arriving on the stage with an urgent message, or in hot pursuit, or marching in. If, as in Accius’ <i>Atreus</i>, Ennius’ Thyestes also made an aggressive move on Atreus, it could be the chorus announcing the messenger who warns Atreus, or Thyestes coming himself.</p> <p>The parallel mentioned in the commentary with the first line of Ennius’ <i>Annals</i> (<i>Musae, quae pedibus magnum pulsatis Olympum</i>, frg. 1 Sk) with its dancing muses highlight that the entering figure might be dancing onto the stage, rather than running or walking. Frg. 1 Sk plays with the association of rhythmic dance with the striding rhythm of the poetic hexameter line, as the Annals was the first Latin epic composed with this meter as opposed to the relatively free Saturnian (see further Hinds (1998) 56-57). There is nothing unusual about the scansion of frg. 138, a fairly standard senarius, with the resolution of the second element of the first metron very common, in the same way that Sk. Ann. 1 is a typical hexameter. The parallel between <i>TrRF</i> frg. 138 M and Ann.1 Sk, with its alliterative pattern, points to an onomatopoeic effect that seems to have interested Ennius, the opportunity to mirror the (rhythmic) movement of feet in the beat of a metrical line, even if <i>TrRF</i> 138 is an iambic senarius not a dactylic hexameter. Previous hypotheses of context have suggested the entry of a character who is running, but the parallel with the Annals might make the arrival of a dancing character or characters – whether that is the chorus or e.g. the drunken Thyestes (see reconstruction) – a possibility worth consideration. A drunken Thyestes might announce the entrance of a dancing chorus, or, vice versa, the chorus might announce the entrance of a drunken Thyestes, who dances and perhaps sings a monody, in the wake of the feast but before Atreus’ revelation. If the line does refer to dancing, perhaps it is a description of Thyestes or the chorus dancing onto the stage, the likeliest characters to be involved in dancing.</p>', 'status': 'Certum', 'context': [], 'lines': [{'line_number': '138', 'text': 'sed sonitus auris meas pedum pulsu increpat'}], 'linked_fragments': ['1fb44081fd62495aba616481daa22ed4', 'b9dda284bca54afdbcd767dfb0d60fa1', '9f008ff573f24cfc82f13a5e62567c24', 'a3a607584a2e492f9a0ae0c66f9595b2'], 'lock': 1, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>

Ribbeck and Warmington place the fragment during the <i>palace miracle</i> when Liber punishes Lycurgus for having apprehended him and his retinue. According to Ribbeck, the fragment shows the palace being destroyed in a manner similar to Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i> 594. Marmorale, however, places the fragment after the death or punishment of Lycurgus. He argues that the Thracians are in uproar because of the death of their king and/or for having accepted the Bacchic rites.

Ribbeck conjectured <i>transtros</i>, and later <i>transtros nostros</i>, the latter of which was also accepted by Warmington. The doubling of -<i>stros</i> could very well explain a scribal slip in the transmission of the original manuscript. Ribbeck’s conjecture is clever, even though <i>transter</i>, the supposed masculine form of <i>transtrum</i>, is not attested. Furthermore, Klotz rejects <i>transtros</i>, because it does not agree with the general sense of <i>late longeque</i>. Bothe suggested <i>Thraces nostros</i> (printed by Klotz as <i>Traces nostros</i>), which is accepted by most editors. It should be noted that all conjectures keep <i>nostros</i> as part of the subject accusative in the ACI construction, perhaps in virtue of keeping the fragmented phrase grammatically contained. In the citing style of Nonius, however, this is not a necessity (cf. TrRF 21, where the main verb is missing).</p>\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>The fragment is an iambic trimeter, if the conjectures of either Ribbeck or Bothe are correct. Klussmann’s adherence to the original manuscripts would make the fragment a cretic, which should therefore be attributed to, for example, a sung part of the choir. Instead, he incorrectly placed the cretic in a messenger’s speech to Lycurgus about the Bacchants being unleashed on his lands.</p>\n\n<p><i>Transtros</i> in the conjecture of Ribbeck and Warmington would refer to the crossbeams or transoms of Lycurgus’ palace, taking on a metonymical sense. Ribbeck explicitly refers to Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i> 594-5 as a predecessor to this fragment: ἅπτε κεραύνιον αἴθοπα λαμπάδα, / σύμφλεγε σύμφλεγε δώματα Πενθέος (kindle the flashing light of a thunderbolt, / burn up, burn up the palace of Pentheus). <i>Nostros</i> implies that the line would have been uttered by Lycurgus, one of his attendants or some other Thracian character announcing the destruction of the palace. The particularity of <i>transtros</i> fits awkwardly with the general sense of <i>late longeque</i> (see Klotz), especially if “crossbeams” is to be taken as a <i>pars pro toto</i> for just one building. Spaltenstein suggests that the general idea conferred by <i>late longeque</i> makes the destruction of the palace final and total, which would make sense from a dramatic perspective. </p>\n\n<p>There are, however, two other reasons to believe that <i>transtros</i> is not the correct conjecture. Firstly, no masculine form of <i>transtrum</i> is attested, about which Ribbeck himself does not make any comment. Secondly, according to Bednarek, since there is no need to postulate a “palace miracle” (i.e. the miraculous destruction of the palace of the king) in the Aeschylean version of the play, there is no need to think that it featured in Naevius’ tragedy. Aeschylus probably described the palace as rejoicing in Bacchic ecstasy rather than being destroyed. </p>\n\n<p>Most editors accept Bothe’s <i>Thraces</i> instead of <i>transtros</i>, later reprinted by Klotz as <i>Traces</i>. Early Latin did not know the aspirations in words originally taken from Greek. Bothe interpreted the line as an observation from Lycurgus, that his people are agitated by the devastation caused by the Bacchants. This would make the line agree with TrRF 30 where a messenger describes the Bacchants destroying the land. Müller suggested that it was indeed Lycurgus uttering these words, but that he was instructing his people to go out and apprehend the Bacchants. Marmorale, on the other hand, argues that these words (spoken by a messenger?) describe the Thracians being agitated by the death of their king or having been converted to the ecstatic rites of Bacchus. Finally, Spaltenstein considers the option that Bacchus or a Bacchant is speaking. <i>Nostros</i> would then signify that the Thracians are in some way under the influence of Bacchus (e.g. conquered or converted).</p>\n\n<p> The manuscripts give <i>fervere</i> a sense of movement, implied by the directional <i>trans</i>. This might be another reason to favour Bothe’s conjecture, which is essentially about the frantic movement of Thracians or recently converted Bacchants. Like Ribbeck’s conjecture it has a clear precedent in Euripides’ <i>Bacchae</i>, namely lines 217-9 spoken by Pentheus: γυναῖκας ἡμῖν δώματ᾿ ἐκλελοιπέναι / πλασταῖσι βακχείαισιν, ἐν δὲ δασκίοις / ὄρεσι θοάζειν (that our women have left their homes / in fabricated Bacchic rites, and that they move quickly in the bushy mountains).

Bentley</i> : vobis <i>coni. Seyffert</i> : <stetis> <i>coni. Lach.</i></p>\n<p>The five MSS <i>Oxonienses</i> record two different variants for <i>istic</i>, <i>ista</i> and <i>istinc</i>. Both variants seem to be scribal overcorrections: the scribes recognise <i> istic</i> as impossible to take with </i>adire</i> and respond with alternatives. <i>ista</i> is presumably to be taken with <i>contagio mea</i> in the following line, while <i>istinc</i> adds the element of motion required by <i>adire</i>. The reading <i>isti</i> in the <i>codex Ambrosianus</i> and the <i>codex Pithoeanus</i> (see commentary <i>ad adesp.</i> 55), to qualify <i>hospites</i>, seems to have arisen in the same way. The unanimity of readings from the <i>de orat.</i> MSS, where the quote is shorter and offers less scope for scribal confusion (lacking <i>nolite hospites ad me adire</i>, there is less opportunity for head-scratching about how <i>ilico istic</i> fits in, as well as the weight of all the <i>codices potiores</i> of the <i>Tusculanae</i>, suggests the majority reading should not be doubted.<br>\nThe variant readings <i>contagio me a</i> and <i>contagio ne a</i>, found in the codex Ottobonianus and the codex Vaticanus of the <i>de oratore</i> should not be given much weight.</p>\n', 'commentary': '<p><b>hospites]</b> The word can be used for ‘hosts’ or ‘guests’ or ‘friends’ or ‘strangers’ or ‘foreigners’, all of this usages evolving out of the concept of hospitality. And each of these meanings might be possible, depending on the reconstruction developed: ‘guests’ or ‘friends’ if the addressees are visitors to the palace in Mycenae or some refuge Thyestes has fled to, or ‘hosts’ if Thyestes has fled to his addressees, seeking sanctuary, or ‘foreigners’ or ‘strangers’ if Thyestes and his addressees do not know each other yet.</p>\n\n<p><b>ilico istic]</b> The phrase (lit. “on that spot there”) is highly emphatic but seems to lack a imperative like <i>state</i> or <i>manete</i>. The collocation is very common in early comedy, as Jocelyn (1967, 420) points out, but never without a verb (cf. Pl. <i>Merc.</i> 912, atque istic sta ilico</i>; <i>Rud.</i> 836 illic astate ilico). Jocelyn suggests that “a gesture by the actor would have taken the place of the verb”, but perhaps a suitable imperative was also found in the preceding line which Cicero does not include.</p>\n  <p><b>⟨meo⟩]</b> Bentley conjectured ⟨meo⟩ in order to turn the final line into a complete bacchiac tetrameter. Others have argued for leaving the line as a cretic tetrameter, although as Jocelyn notes, a switch from bacchiacs to cretics without any motivation (e.g. a change in the speaker’s tone) would be highly unusual. Jocelyn offers up the idea that a conjecture may not be required since truncated bacchiacs can occur, but in the examples he cites, none have a cretic opening: instead they have a bacchius, a molossus or a choliamb. Bothe’s conjecture is the most persuasive offering – but if adopted, would its omission be a lapse on Cicero’s part or scribes in the tradition? Perhaps the former, given the cretic rhythm would still be recognisably lyric but Cicero might not be totally sensitive to the usage of bacchiacs in early Roman choral lyrics.\n', 'reconstruction': '<p>As an <i>adespoton</i>, we cannot be entirely sure which work or which author <i>TrRF</i> 55 <i>adesp.</i> belonged to, since Cicero makes no reference to a specific work or author on either of the occasions he quotes the line, only in the <i>Tusculans</i> mentioning it is about Thyestes. However, many editors have thought that the line belongs to Ennius’ <i>Thyestes</i>. \n<p>While Stephanus (1564) placed it in his <i>adespota</i>, Columna (1590) attributed the fragment to <i>Thyestes</i>, on the basis of the context of the citation in the <i>Tusculanae disputationes</i>. For Warmington (1935), the line belonged to a scene set in the wake of the feast, as Thyestes arrives at the court of King Thesprotus. That is, the scene belongs to the second half of the play, given Warmington’s reconstruction of the <i>Thyestes</i> includes both the feast and the aftermath. For Jocelyn, since the <i>hospites</i> are presumably the chorus, then they need background information on who Thyestes is midway through the play, and so Jocelyn thought that Frr. 55 and 56 <i>adesp.</i> must occur near the beginning of the play. Of course, this neglects the possibility of fitting two choruses into Warmington’s hypothesis: a chorus of Myceneans in Mycene for the first part of the play, and a chorus of Thesprotians at Thesprotia for the second half of the play.</p>\n<p>While the majority of commentators have thought the <i>scelus</i> which Thyestes refers to is the <i>cena Thyestea</i>, Segura Morena (who splices Fr. 55 and 56 <i>adesp.</i> together) suggested that this fragment is actually Thyestes’ confession of his adultery with Aerope. This would necessarily place the fragment early in a <i>Thyestes</i> play solely about the feast, and it does address the issue of background information usually coming sooner rather than later. It would represent a major divergence from Seneca’s <i>Thyestes</i> to have Thyestes’ adultery confessed by him (he makes no reference to it in Seneca’s play). However, as Littlewood highlights, Aerope may have had a much more prominent role in one of Sophocles’ lost plays (see Littlewood (1997) 62-63).</p>\n', 'status': 'Adesp.', 'context': [], 'lines': [{'line_number': '1', 'text': 'nolite hospites ad me adire, ilico istic!'}, {'line_number': '2', 'text': 'ne contagio mea bonis umbrave obsit!'}, {'line_number': '3', 'text': '⟨meo⟩ tanta vis sceleris in corpore haeret!'}], 'linked_fragments': ['db4a59a7ec6a44e797a71cf105fe1adc', '3062660752394c7eb2a3ed733ad26e39', 'd8c9537e930545a9bd38873476ad6cb8', 'd2462ca3503c4056ac9c867660203fc5'], 'lock': 1, 'linked_bib_entries': []}>
